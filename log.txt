Generated seq by model:- they describe the story it is invariably &quot;The Last Question&quot;. This has reached the point where I recently received a long-distance phone call from a desperate man who began, &quot;Dr. Asimov, there's a story I think you wrote, whose title I can't remember&amp;mdash;&quot; at which point I interrupted to tell him it was &quot;The Last Question&quot; and when I described the plot it proved to be indeed the story he was after. I left him convinced I could read minds at a distance of a thousand miles.  Beginning in 1977, he lent his name to ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' (now ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'') and penned an editorial for each issue.  There was also a short-lived ''Asimov's SF Adventure Magazine'' and a companion ''Asimov's Science Fiction Anthology'' reprint series, published as magazines (in the same manner as stablemates ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine]]'''s &quot;anthologies&quot;).  ===Popular science=== During the late 1950s and 1960s, Asimov shifted gears somewhat, and substantially decreased his fiction output (he published only four adult novels between 1957's ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' and 1982's ''Foundation's Edge'', two of which were mysteries). At the same time, he greatly increased his non-fiction production, writing mostly on science topics; the launch of [[Sputnik]] in 1957 engendered public concern over a &quot;science gap&quot;, which Asimov's publishers were eager to fill with as much material as he could write. Meanwhile, the monthly ''[[Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'' invited him to continue his regular non-fiction column, begun in the now-folded bimonthly companion magazine ''[[Venture Science Fiction]]'', ostensibly dedicated to [[popular science]], but with Asimov having complete editorial freedom. The first of the ''F&amp;SF'' columns appeared in November of 1958, and they followed uninterrupted thereafter, with 399 entries, until Asimov's terminal illness took its toll.  These columns, periodically collected into books by his principal publisher, [[Doubleday]], helped make Asimov's reputation as a &quot;Great Explainer&quot; of science and were referred to by him as his only pop-science writing in which he never had to assume complete ignorance of the subjects at hand on the part of his readers.  The popularity of his first wide-ranging reference work, ''The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science'', also allowed him to give up most of his academic responsibilities and become essentially a full-time freelance writer.  He published ''Asimov's Guide to the Bible'' in two volumes&amp;mdash;covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969&amp;mdash;and then combined them into one 1300-page volume in 1981. Replete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the [[Bible]] in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters.

Like the natural numbers, the integers form a [[countably infinite]] set. The [[set]] of all integers is usually denoted in [[mathematics]] by a boldface '''Z''' (or [[blackboard bold]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;), which stands for ''Zahlen'' ([[German language|German]] for &quot;numbers&quot;).   The term '''rational integer''' is used, in [[algebraic number theory]], to distinguish these 'ordinary' integers, in the [[rational number]]s, from other concepts such as the [[Gaussian integer]]s.  == Algebraic properties ==  Like the natural numbers, '''Z''' is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the [[binary operation|operations]] of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]], that is, the sum and product of any two integers is an integer.  However, with the inclusion of the negative natural numbers, and, importantly, [[0 (number)|zero]], '''Z''' (unlike the natural numbers) is also closed under [[subtraction]]. '''Z''' is not closed under the operation of [[division (mathematics)|division]], since the quotient of two integers (''e.g.'', 1 divided by 2), need not be an integer.

During mid-second millennium AD, several [[Europe]]an countries, including [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], who initially wanted to trade with India, took advantage of the fractured kingdoms fighting each other, to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the country. An 1857 insurrection against the [[British East India Company]] failed, known locally as the [[Sepoy Mutiny|First War of Indian Independence]], and in British and some Western literature as the Indian Mutiny, Sepoy Mutiny or Sepoy Rebellion.  After it was put down, much of India came under the direct administrative control of the crown of the [[British Empire]].  In 1918, India was severly struck by the [[Spanish flu pandemic]], suffering an estimated death toll of 17 million (a mortality rate of around 5% of the population).   In the early twentieth century, the prolonged, non-violent [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]] was led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], widely regarded as the &quot;Father Of The Nation.&quot; The struggle culminated on [[1947-08-15]], when India gained full independence from British rule, and became a [[republic]] on [[1950-01-26]].  As a [[ethnic|multi-ethnic]] and multi-religious nation, India has had some sectarian violence and [[insurgency|insurgencies]] in various parts of the country, but has stayed together as a vibrant [[democracy]]. It has unresolved border disputes with [[People's Republic of China|China]] (which escalated into the brief [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962), and with [[Pakistan]], which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and in 1999 in [[Kargil]] (at the northern fringe of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] State).  India is a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]]. In 1974, India conducted an underground [[Smiling Buddha|nuclear test]], making it an unofficial member of the &quot;[[nuclear club]]&quot;. This was followed by a series of [[Operation Shakti|five more]] tests in  in 1998. Significant economic reforms beginning in 1991 have transformed India into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, and added to its global and regional clout. Today India is considered as one of the [[major powers]] and also as one of the [[Superpower#Potential Superpowers|emerging future superpowers]].  {{see also|History of South India|Military history of India|Timeline of Indian history}}  ==Government== {{main|Government of India}}  {| class=&quot;toccolours&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin: 1em; padding: 1em; width: 220px; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%; clear: right&quot; |+ National symbols of India |-  | style=&quot;padding-left: 1em;&quot; | '''Flag''' | [[Tiranga]] |- | style=&quot;padding-left: 1em;&quot; | '''Emblem''' | [[Emblem of India|Sarnath Lion]] |- | style=&quot;padding-left: 1em;&quot; | '''Anthem''' | [[Jana Gana Mana]] |- --×--Ë-ËÉ!Î-----Ð---Ù----ápá

Generated seq by model:- tion to essential flood control, a dam would make possible the expansion of irrigated farming in the parched region.  It would also provide a dependable supply of water for [[Los Angeles]] and other [[Southern California]] communities. One of the major obstacles for the project was determining the equitable allocation of the waters of the [[Colorado River]]. Several of the Colorado River Basin states feared that [[California]], with its vast financial resources and great thirst for water, would be the first state to begin beneficial use of the waters of the Colorado River and therefore claim rights to the majority of the water. It was clear that without some sort of an agreement on the distribution of water, the project could not proceed.  == Planning and agreements ==  A commission was formed in 1922 with a representative from each of the Basin states and one from the Federal Government. The Government's representative was [[Herbert Hoover]], then Secretary of Commerce under President [[Warren Harding]]. In January 1922, Hoover met with the state governors of Arizona, California,  Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming to work out an equitable arrangement for apportioning the waters of the Colorado River for their states' use.  The resulting [[Colorado River Compact]], signed on [[November 24]], [[1922]], split the river basin into upper and lower halves with the states within each region deciding how the water would be divided.  This agreement, known as the Hoover Compromise, paved the way for the Boulder Dam Project.   The first attempt to gain Congressional approval for construction of Boulder Dam came in 1922 with the introduction of two bills in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The bills were introduced by Congressman [[Phil Swing|Phil D. Swing]] and Senator [[Hiram W. Johnson]] and were known as the Swing-Johnson bills. The bills failed to come up for a vote and were subsequently reintroduced several times. In December 1928, both the House and the Senate finally approved the bill and sent it to the President for approval. On [[December 21]], [[1928]], President [[Calvin Coolidge]] signed the bill approving the Boulder Canyon Project. The initial appropriation for construction was made in July 1930, by which time [[Herbert Hoover]] had become President.  Early plans called for the dam to be built in Boulder Canyon, so the project was known as the Boulder Canyon Project. The dam was actually built in Black Canyon, but the project was still called the Boulder Canyon Project.   === Contractors === The contract to construct the dam was awarded to [[Six Companies|Six Companies, Inc.]], a joint venture of Morrison-Knudsen Company of Boise, Idaho; Utah Construction Company of Ogden, Utah; Pacific Bridge Company of Portland, Oregon; Henry J. Kaiser &amp; W. A. Bechtel Company of Oakland, California; McDonald &amp; Kahn Ltd. of Los Angeles; and J. F. Shea Company of Portland, Oregon.

Generated seq by model:- er losing their account (whether it be from an Internet service provider or from a website) as a consequence of their reckless trolling.  There are those who argue that a lack of response to trolling can also inspire trolling, a &quot;Damned if you do, damned if you don't&quot; result. Particularly fanatical or irrational commentators will respond to a forum that irks them largely independent of responses. Trolls also often continue to post, taking umbrage with peripheral arguments or arguments that were less well-founded, until their positions become untenable, then turning either to insults or moving to another topic. By this logic, relentless confrontation through argument of trolls (when such argument is to be found) can be vital.  ==Usefulness of trolling== A major debate on the Internet is whether or not trolls perform any ''useful'' function. Because troll is such a broadly-applied term, if all definitions thereof are to be accepted, the answer must definitively be &quot;yes and no&quot;.  Users performing many useful, but controversial, functions are often decried as trolls, and in these cases, so-called trolling may actually benefit the forum in which it occurs. For example, the presence of a radical right-winger, described as a troll, may allow a conservative lurker to feel more comfortable expressing his or her viewpoints, which seem very moderate in contrast. On the other hand, if trollhunters mount a [[flame war]] against this right-wing troll, the conservative bystander may feel ''less'' comfortable in expressing her views, to the detriment of the forum. As much as trolls claim to fight [[groupthink]], they may actually encourage it by solidifying opinion against them.  Trolls can also, in some circumstances, be a source of genuine humour, which depends entirely upon whether the troll is a good or a bad troll. It is usually fairly easy to spot the difference between such actions: a bad troll resorts only to weak uncreative arguments, whereas a good troll will create a subtle set of arguments which draw people in, with cunning twists to provide a thread of [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequitur]] humour.  Trolls may also provide a valuable service by making people question the validity of what is read both on the Internet, and from other sources. Trolls show that expressing any opinion is as easy as expressing an informed and considered opinion, and may get as much visibility. It has also been argued that [[shock jocks]], and newspaper [[columnist]]s, often track public opinions by trolling. [[John C. Dvorak]], and [[Slashdot]], have often been cited as examples.  Even though useful content and productive users are sometimes decried as trolls, the consensus is that pure &quot;trolling&quot; benefits only the troll and trollhunters, and has no place in any forum. Most forums reject the claim that pure and intentional trolling serves any useful purpose. Some trolls have been known to try to troll threads into deletion, serving as a form of negative reinforcement to &quot;newbies&quot;, but also helping at |è]µ¸ ÕÎÖÏÕÖÎ¤éèæÖç 1º¾³

Generated seq by model:-  India was thought to have negligible activity related to tsunamis, though there is historical anecdotal evidence of its occurrence in the past.  India has one [[active volcano]]: the [[Barren Island (Andaman Islands)|Barren Island]] volcano which last erupted in May 2005. There is also a [[dormant volcano]] called the [[Narcondum]] and a [[Mud volcano]] at [[Baratang]]. All these volcanoes lie in the [[Andaman Islands]].  [[Landslide]]s are common in the Lower Himalaya owing to labile rock formations due to the young age of the hills. Parts of the Western Ghats also suffer from low intensity landslides. [[Avalanche]]s occur in Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim.  During the summer months, dust storms cause immense property damage in northern India. These storms bring with it large amounts of dust from arid regions. [[Hailstones]] are common in parts of India, and cause severe damage to the standing crops.  == Natural resources == India is particularly rich in a variety of natural resources.  Along with 56% arable land, it has significant sources of [[Coal]] (fourth-largest reserves in the world), [[Iron]] ore, [[Manganese]], [[Mica]], [[Bauxite]], [[Titanium]] ore, [[Chromite]], [[Natural gas]], [[Diamond]]s, [[Petroleum]], [[Limestone]], [[Thorium]] (world's largest along [[Kerala]]'s shores).  Petroleum is found off the coast of Maharashtra, Gujarat and in Assam, but meets only 40% of India's demand. Increasing amounts of natural gas are being discovering regularly especially off the coast of Andhra Pradesh. [[Uranium]] is mined in Andhra Pradesh and [[gold]] in the [[Kolar Gold Fields]] in Karnataka.  == International agreements == India is a party to several International agreements related to environment and climate, the most prominent among them are:  {| width=&quot;100%&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#fff4f4&quot; !align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Treaties and Agreements |-align=&quot;center&quot; !align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;| Specific Regions and [[Sea]]s |align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;|&lt;small&gt;[[Government of Antarctica|The Antarctic Treaty]], [[Law of the Sea]], Ship Pollution ([[MARPOL 73/78]]), [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling|Whaling]]&lt;/small&gt; |-align=&quot;center&quot; !align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;| [[Earth's atmosphere|Atmosphere]] and [[Climate]] |align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;|&lt;small&gt;[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Kyoto Protocol]], [[Montreal Protocol|Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|Nuclear Test Ban]]&lt;/small&gt; |-align=&quot;center&quot; !align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;| [[Biodiversity]], [[Natural environment|Environment]] and [[Forest]]s |align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;|&lt;small&gt;[[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Desertification]], [[Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna|Endangered Species]], [[Convention on the Prohibition of®Ö¬áÕ  å )º¬êáãÏèè¿å¥©ê

Generated seq by model:- ung]] (&quot;Great [[Sultan]]&quot;) in Javanese records. Agung was responsible for the great expansion and lasting historical legacy of Mataram due to the extensive military conquests of his long reign from [[1613]] to [[1646]].   After years of war Agung finally conquered Surabaya.  The city was taken not through outright military invasion, but instead because Agung surrounded it on land and sea, starving it into submission. With Surabaya brought into the empire, the Mataram kingdom encompassed all of central and eastern Java, and [[Madura]]; only in the west did [[Banten]] and the Dutch settlement in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] remain outside Agung's control.  He tried repeatedly in the 1620s and 1630s to drive the Dutch from Batavia, but his armies had met their match, and he was forced to share control over Java.  In [[1645]] he began building [[Imogiri]], his burial place, about fifteen kilometers south of Yogyakarta.  Imogiri remains the resting place of most of the royalty of Yogyakarta and Surakarta to this day. Agung died in the spring of [[1646]], with his image of royal invincibility shattered by his losses to the Dutch, but he did leave behind an empire that covered most of Java and stretched to its neighboring islands.  Upon taking the throne, Agung's son Susuhunan [[Amangkurat I of Mataram|Amangkurat I]] tried to bring long-term stability to Mataram's realm, murdering local leaders that were insufficiently deferential to him, and closing ports so he alone had control over trade with the Dutch.  By the mid-1670s dissatisfaction with the king fanned into open revolt, beginning at the margins and creeping inward. [[Raden Trunajaya]], a prince from Madura, lead a revolt fortified by itinerant fighters from faraway [[Makassar]] that captured the king's court at Mataram in mid-[[1677]]. The king escaped to the north coast with his eldest son, the future king [[Amangkurat II of Mataram|Amangkurat II]], leaving his younger son Pangeran Puger in Mataram. Apparently more interested in profit and revenge than in running a struggling empire, the rebel Trunajaya looted the court and withdrew to his stronghold in East Java leaving Puger in control of a weak court.  Amangkurat I died just after his expulsion, making Amangkurat II king in 1677. He too was nearly helpless, though, having fled without an army or treasury to build one. In an attempt to regain his kingdom, he made substantial concessions to the Dutch, who then went to war to reinstate him. For the Dutch, a stable Mataram empire that was deeply indebted to them would help ensure continued trade on favorable terms. They were willing to lend their military might to keep the kingdom together. Dutch forces first captured Trunajaya, then forced Puger to recognize the sovereignty of his elder brother Amangkurat II.  ==Colonial era== Beginning in [[1602]] the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] gradually established themselves as rulers of what is now Indonesia, exploiting the fractionalization of the small kingdoms that had replaced Majapahit.

Generated seq by model:- he indigenous population. There are now well in excess of one million Irish born residents, with some estimates putting the total Irish diaspora in Britain at as much as 20 percent of the population, or [[millions|12 million]]. This is largely due to the flow of immigrants from Ireland during the many famines there and particularly 'The Great Famine' of 1845 - 1850. Immigration continued into the next century, when the numbers of immigrants during the 1950's and 1960's began to increase, many settling in the larger cities and towns of Britain. [[London]] once more holds an official [[St. Patrick's Day]] which had previously been cancelled in the 1970s because of terrorist activity.  ==Europe== Irish links with the continent go back many centuries. During the early Middle Ages, many Irish religious went abroad to preach and found monasteries. [[Saint Brieuc]] founded the city that bears his name in [[Brittany]], and [[Columbanus|Saint ColmÃ¡n]] founded the great monastery of [[Bobbio]] in [[northern Italy]].  During the [[Counter-Reformation]], Irish religious and political links with Europe became stronger. [[Louvain]] in Belgium grew into an important centre of learning for Irish priests. The [[Flight of the Earls]] in 1607 led much of the Gaelic nobility to flee the country, and after the wars of the 17th century many others fled to Spain, France, Austria, and other Catholic lands. The lords and their retainers and supporters joined the armies of these countries, and were known as the [[Flight of the Wild Geese|Wild Geese]]. Some of the lords and and their descendents rose to high ranks in their adoptive countries, such as the French royalist [[Patrice MacMahon, duc de Magenta|Patrice de MacMahon]], who became [[president of France]].    During the 20th century, certain Irish intellectuals made their homes in continental Europe, particularly [[James Joyce]], and later [[Samuel Beckett]] (who became a courier for the [[French Resistance]]).

Generated seq by model:- in Baptism.  As &quot;by one Spirit we were all baptized,&quot; so we are also &quot;made to drink of one Spirit.&quot; (1 Cor 12:13) Thus the Spirit is also personally the living water welling up from Christ crucified (Jn 19:34; 1 Jn 5:8) as its source and welling up in us to eternal life. (Cf. Jn 4:10-14; 738; Ex 17:1-6; Isa 55:1; Zech 14:8; 1 Cor 10:4; Rev 21:6; 22:17)  *''Anointing'' - The symbolism of anointing with oil also signifies the Holy Spirit, to the point of becoming a synonym for the Holy Spirit. (Cf. 1 Jn 2:20:27; 2 Cor 1:21) In Christian initiation, anointing is the sacramental sign of Confirmation, called &quot;chrismation&quot; in the Churches of the East. Its full force can be grasped only in relation to the primary anointing accomplished by the Holy Spirit, that of Jesus. Christ (in Hebrew &quot;messiah&quot;) means the one &quot;anointed&quot; by God's Spirit.   *''Fire'' -  symbolizes the transforming energy of the Holy Spirit's actions. In the form of tongues &quot;as of fire,&quot; the Holy Spirit rests on the disciples on the morning of Pentecost and fills them with himself.  *''Cloud and light'' - The Spirit comes upon the Virgin Mary and &quot;overshadows&quot; her, so that she might conceive and give birth to Jesus. On the mountain of Transfiguration, the Spirit in the &quot;cloud came and overshadowed&quot; Jesus, Moses and Elijah, Peter, James and John, and &quot;a voice came out of the cloud, saying, 'This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!'&quot; (Lk 9:34-35)  *''The seal'' is a symbol close to that of anointing. &quot;The Father has set his seal&quot; on Christ and also seals us in him. (Jn 6:27; cf. 2 Cor 1:22; Eph 1:13; 4:3) Because this seal indicates the indelible effect of the anointing with the Holy Spirit in the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders, the image of the seal (sphragis) has been used in some theological traditions to express the indelible &quot;character&quot; imprinted by these three unrepeatable sacraments.  *''The hand''. It is by the Apostles' imposition of hands that the Holy Spirit is given. The Letter to the Hebrews lists the imposition of hands among the &quot;fundamental elements&quot; of its teaching. The Church has kept this sign of the all-powerful outpouring of the Holy Spirit in its sacramental epicleses.  *''The finger.'' &quot;It is by the finger of God that [Jesus] cast out demons.&quot; If God's law was written on tablets of stone &quot;by the finger of God,&quot; then the &quot;letter from Christ&quot; entrusted to the care of the apostles, is written &quot;with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.&quot; (Ex 31:18; 2 Cor 3:3)  *''The dove.''  When Christ comes up from the water of his baptism, the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, comes down upon him and remains with him.  ===Orthodoxy=== [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] proclaims that the Father is the eternal source of the Godhead, from Whom is begotten the Son eternally and also from Whom the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally.

This rate of loss can be measured and is used to determine the stage of infection. The loss of CD4+ T-cells is linked with an increase in viral load. The clinical course of HIV-infection generally includes three stages: primary infection, clinical latency and AIDS (Figure 1).

Generated seq by model:- islands stretching from [[Sumatra]] through [[Java (island)|Java]] to the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]. On the busy crossings between Sumatra, Java, and [[Bali]], multiple car ferries run frequently twenty-four hours per day. There are also international ferry services between across the [[Straits of Malacca]] between Sumatra and [[Malaysia]], and between [[Singapore]] and nearby Indonesian islands, such as [[Batam]].  A network of passenger ships makes longer connections to more remote islands, especially in the eastern part of the archipelago. The national shipping line, [[Pelni]], provides passenger service to [[port]]s throughout the country on a two to four week schedule.  These ships generally provide the least expensive way to cover long distances between islands.  Still smaller privately-run boats provide service between islands.    On some islands, major rivers provide a key transportation link in the absence of good roads. On [[Kalimantan]], [[longboat]]s running on the rivers are the only way to reach many inland areas. Indonesia has  21,579 km of navigable waterways ([[As of 2004|2004]]), of which about one half are on Kalimantan, and a quarter each on Sumatra and [[Papua]].   Major ports and harbors include [[Cilacap]], [[Cirebon]], [[Jakarta]], [[Kupang]], [[Palembang]], [[Semarang]], [[Surabaya]], and [[Makassar]]. Ports are managed by the various [[Indonesia Port Corporation|Indonesia Port Corporations]], of which there are four, numbered I through IV. Each has jurisdiction over various regions of the country, with I in the west and IV in the east.  == Roads and highways == [[Image:Bemo.jpg|thumb|right|Loading cargo onto a minibus]]A wide variety of vehicles are used for transportation on Indonesia's roads.   [[Bus]] services are available in most areas connected to the road network.  Between major cities, especially on Sumatra, Java, and Bali, services are frequent and direct; many services are available with no stops until the final destination.  In more remote areas, and between smaller towns, most services are provided with [[minibus]]es or small vans.  Buses and vans are also the primary form of transportation within cities.  Many cities and towns have some form of transportation for hire available as well, such as [[Taxicab|taxi]]s and motorized [[autorickshaw]]s. [[Cycle rickshaw]]s, called ''becak'' in Indonesia, are common in many cities, and provide an inexpensive form of in-town transportation. They have been blamed for causing [[traffic congestion]] and banned from most parts of central [[Jakarta]]. [[Horse]]-drawn carts are found in some cities and towns.  Private [[automobile|car]]s are far too expensive for the majority of the population, and are uncommon except in larger cities.  Indonesia has about 158,670 km of paved highways and about 184,000 km of unpaved highways ([[As of 1999|1999]] estimate).  == Railways == {{main|Rail transport in Indonesia}} Most railways in Indonesia are on Java, which has two major rail lines that run the length of the island, as well as several minor lines.

The [[United States]] government has set strict rules on setting cookies in 2000 after it was disclosed that the White House drug policy office used cookies to track computer users viewing its online antidrug advertising to see if they then visited sites about drug making and drug use. In 2002, privacy activist [[Daniel Brandt]] found that the [[CIA]] had been leaving persistent cookies in people's computers for ten years.

On [[December 25]], [[2005]], Brandt discovered that the [[National Security Agency]] had been leaving two persistent cookies on visitors' computers due to a software upgrade.

In particular, Article 5, Paragraph 3 of this directive mandates that storing data (like cookies) in a user's computer can only be done if: first, the user is provided information about how this data is used; and second, the user is given the possibility of denying this storing operation. However, this article also states that storing data that is necessary for technical reasons is exempted from this rule. This directive was expected to have been applied since October 2003, but a [http://europa.eu.int/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/implementation_enforcement/annualreports/10threport/sec20041535vol1en.pdf December 2004 report] says (page 38) that this provision was not applied in practice, and that some member countries ([[Slovakia]], [[Latvia]], [[Greece]], [[Belgium]], and [[Luxembourg]]) did not even transpose it. The same report suggests a thorough analysis of the situation in the Member States.  ==Drawbacks of cookies== Besides privacy concerns, there are some other reasons why cookies have been opposed: they do not always accurately identify users, and they can be used for security attacks.  ===Inaccurate identification=== If more than one browser is used on a computer, each has a separate storage area for cookies. Hence cookies do not identify a person, but a combination of a user account, a computer, and a Web browser.
