Generated seq by model:- s]], which, together with [[international finance]], forms the larger branch of [[international economics]].  ==International trade theory== Several different models have been proposed to predict patterns of trade and to analyze the effects of trade policies such as tariffs.  ===Ricardian model=== The [[Ricardian model]] focuses on [[comparative advantage]] and is perhaps the most important concept in international [[trade]] [[theory]].  In a Ricardian model, countries specialize in producing what they produce best.  Unlike other models, the Ricardian framework predicts that countries will fully specialize instead of producing a broad array of goods. Also, the Ricardian model does not directly consider factor endowments, such as the relative amounts of labor and capital within a country.  ===Heckscher-Ohlin model=== The [[Heckscher-Ohlin model]] was produced as an alternative to the Ricardian model of basic comparative advantage. Despite its more complex and accurate predictive power, it also had an [[ideological]] mission: the elimination of the labor theory of value and the incorporation of the neoclassical price mechanism into international trade theory. The theory argues that the pattern of international trade is determined by differences in [[factor]] [[endowments]]. It predicts that countries will [[export]] those [[good (economics)|goods]] that make intensive use of locally abundant factors and will [[import]] goods that make intensive use of factors that are locally scarce.  ===Specific Factors=== {{sectstub}}  ===Gravity model=== The [[Gravity model of trade]] presents a more empirical analysis of trading patterns rather than the more theoretical models discussed above.  The gravity model, in its basic form, predicts trade based on the distance between countries and the interaction of the countries' economic sizes.  The model mimics the Newtonian [[law of gravity]] which also considers distance and physical size between two objects.  The model has been proven to be empirically strong through [[econometric]] analysis.  Other factors such as income level, diplomatic relationships between countries, and trade policies are also included in expanded verisions of the model.  ==Regulation of international trade==  Traditionally trade was regulated through [[bilateral]] treaties between two nations.  For centuries under the belief in [[Mercantilism]] most nations had high [[tariff]]s and many restrictions on international trade.  In the 19th century, especially in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], a belief in [[free trade]] became paramount and this view has dominated thinking among western nations for most of the time since then. In the years since the [[Second World War]] [[multilateral]] treaties like the [[GATT]] and [[World Trade Organization]] have attempted to create a globally regulated trade structure.  [[Communist]] and [[socialist]] nations often believe in [[autarky]], a complete lack of international trade.  [[Fascist]] and other authoritarian governments have also placed great emphasis on [[self-sufficiency]. eac   ca  cul= eehth an a gt

Generated seq by model:- ] there has been a general move away from religious observance and belief in Christian teachings and a move towards [[secularism]].  The &quot;secularization of society&quot;, attributed to the time of the Renaissance and its following years, is largely responsible for the spread of secularism.  For example the Gallup International Millennium Survey[http://www.gallup-international.com/survey15.htm] showed that only about one sixth of Europeans attend regular religious services, less than half gave God &quot;high importance&quot;, and only about 40% believe in a &quot;personal God&quot;.  Nevertheless the large majority considered that they &quot;belong&quot; to a [[religious denomination]]. Numbers show that the &quot;de-Christianization&quot; of Europe has slowly begun to swing in the opposite direction.  Renewal in certain quarters of the Anglican church, as well as in pockets of Protestantism on the continent attest to this initial reversal of the secularization of Europe, the continent in which Christianity originally took its strongest roots and world expansion.  In [[North America]], [[South America]] and [[Australia]], the other three continents where Christianity is the dominant professed religion, religious observance is much higher than in Europe.  At the same time, these regions are often seen by other nations as being uptight and &quot;Victorian&quot;, in their social mores.  In general, the United States leans toward the conservative in comparison to other western nations in its general culture, in part due to the Christian element found primarily in its mid-western and southern states.   South America, historically Catholic, has experienced a large Evangelical and Pentecostal infusion in the 20th Century due to the influx of Christian missionaries from abroad.  For example: [[Brazil]], South America's largest country, is the largest Catholic country in the world, and at the same time is the largest Evangelical country in the world (based on population).  Some of the largest Christian congregations in the world are found in Brazil.     Australia has seen renewal in different parts of her Anglican Church, as well as a growing presence of an Evangelical community.  Although more &quot;traditional&quot; in its Anglican roots, the nation has seen growth in its religious sector. Some of its religious programming is even exported via satellite.  == 21st century == *[[Emerging Church]] *[[Paleo-Orthodoxy]] *[[Christianity and Islam]] *[[Homosexuality and Christianity]]  ==Historiography== Noted historians of Christianity include: * [[Eusebius]] * [[Gregory of Tours]] * [[Caesar Baronius]] * [[Isaac Casaubon]] * [[Edward Gibbon]]  ==See also== *[[History of the Roman Catholic Church]] *[[Revival (religious)]] *[[Timeline of Christianity]] *[[Esoteric Christianity]] Christian religion as a Mystery religion *[[Jesus in the Christian Bible]] *[[Cultural and historical background of Jesus]]  ==Print resources== * {{cite book  | last = Gonzales | first = Justo  | title = The Story of Christianity: Vol. 1: The Early Cu areeie  et neee hrri hialoe

Generated seq by model:- measures the latency between squeeze and contraction by observing the anal sphincter or by feeling it with a gloved finger inserted past the anus. Specific nerve tests are used in patients with suspected nerve damage as a result of diabetes or nerve disease.  ===Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT)=== It is normal for a man to have five to six erections during sleep, especially during rapid eye movement (REM). Their absence may indicate a problem with nerve function or blood supply in the penis. There are two methods for measuring changes in penile rigidity and circumference during nocturnal erection: snap gauge and strain gauge.  ===Penile biothesiometry=== This test uses electromagnetic vibration to evaluate sensitivity and nerve function in the glans and shaft of the penis. A decreased perception of vibration may indicate nerve damage in the pelvic area, which can lead to impotence.  ==Pathophysiology== Penile erection is managed by two different mechanisms. The first one is the reflex erection, which is achieved by directly touching the penile shaft. The second is the psychogenic erection, which is achieved by erotic stimuli. The former uses the peripheral nerves and the lower parts of the spinal cord, whereas the latter uses the [[limbic system]] of the [[brain]]. In both conditions an intact neural system is required for a successful and complete erection. Stimulation of penile shaft by the [[nervous system]] leads to the secretion of [[nitric oxide]] (NO), which causes the relaxation of smooth muscles of corpora cavernosa (the main erectile tissue of penis), and subsequently penile erection.  Additionally, adequate levels of [[testosterone]] (produced by the [[testes]]) and an intact [[pituitary gland]] are required for the development of a healthy male erectile system. As can be understood from the mechanisms of a normal erection, impotence may develop due to hormonal deficiency, disorders of the neural system, lack of adequate penile blood supply or psychological problems.  A few causes of impotence may be [[iatrogenic]] (medically caused). Various [[antihypertensive]]s (medications intended to control [[arterial hypertension|high blood pressure]]) and some drugs that modify [[central nervous system]] response may inhibit erection by denying blood supply or by altering nerve activity.  Antidepressants, especially SSRIs, can cause impotence as a side effect.  Surgical intervention for a number of different conditions may remove anatomical structures necessary to erection, damage nerves, or impair blood supply.  Some studies have shown that [[male circumcision]] may result in an increased risk of impotence, [http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/palmer/] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=14979200&amp;dopt=Abstract] while others have found no such effect, [http://www.circs.org/library/senkul/] [http://www.circs.org/library/collins/] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16037710&amp;query_horg   drnee d iu at sd e    dd

Its management also continued to be in the hands of a small contingent of underpaid or volunteer &quot;section managers&quot; who were receiving ever-growing quantities of information on films from around the world and across time from contributors of widely varying level of expertise and informational resources.  Despite the annual claims of Needham, in a year-end report newsletter to the Top 50 contributors, that &quot;fewer holes&quot; must now remain for the coming year, the amount of information still missing from the database was vastly underestimated.  Over the next few years, the database was run on a network of [[mirror (computing)|mirrors]] across the world with donated bandwidth.  ===As an independent company===  In [[1995]], it became obvious to the principal site managers that the project had become too large to maintain merely through donations and in their spare time. The decision was made to become a commercial venture and in [[1996]], IMDb was incorporated in the [[United Kingdom]], becoming the Internet Movie Database Ltd, with [[Col Needham]] the primary owner as well as identifed figurehead. The remaining shareholders were the people maintaining the database. Revenue was generated through advertising, licensing and partnerships.  This state of affairs continued until [[1998]]. The database was growing every day, and it was again reaching a critical point.  Most revenues were being spent on equipment, and shareholders were finding it difficult to reconcile the fact that for all their hard work they themselves were getting very little income. Many, by this time, had families to support and interact with, and could not hold regular paying jobs and meet the increasing needs of the database.  The company's ability to add and upgrade equipment was dwindling, while the number of new informational submissions, as well as fan text, were increasing incrementally.  The system was suffering noticeable slowdowns both in accessing the site and in having new data posted.  Offers were solicited and received from major businesses to purchase the database; however, the shareholders were unwilling to sell if it could not be guaranteed that the information would be accessible to the internet community for free.  ===As a subsidiary company===  In 1999, [[Jeff Bezos]], founder, owner and CEO of [[Amazon.com]] struck a deal with Col Needham and other principal shareholders, to buy IMDb outright and attach it to his corporate empire as a subsidiary, private company.   This gave IMDb the ability to pay the shareholders salaries for their work, while Amazon.com would be able to use the IMDb as an advertising resource for selling [[DVD]]s and [[videotape]]s.  Volunteer contributors were not advised in advance of even the possibility of IMDb - and their contributions along with it - being sold to a private business, which created some initial discord and defection of regulars.  Promises to recompense all major contributors in some unspecified way for their prior services were issued by Col Needham in b   e e  ie  e aes  eeeea i ae

It occurs when [[supercooled]] [[water]] [[Drop (liquid)|droplet]]s (remaining in a [[liquid]] state despite being below the [[freezing point]], 0 Â°C/32 Â°F) in a [[storm]] [[cloud]] [[aggregate]]s around some solid object, such as a [[dust]] [[particle]] or an already-forming hailstone.  The water then freezes around the object.  Depending on the [[wind]] patterns within the cloud, the hailstone may continue to circulate for some time, increasing in size.  Eventually, the hailstone falls to the ground, when the updraft is no longer strong enough to support its [[weight]].  [[image:hailstorm.jpg|left|thumb|Hailstorm]]  Hail often forms in strong [[thunderstorm]]s, often along a [[cold front]], where the layer of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]] on top is much colder than that on the bottom.  The smaller hailstones can bounce up and down between the warm and cold layers due to [[updraft]]s and [[gravity]].  The longer the stones bounce around, the larger they grow.  For the same reason, larger hail can occur in warmer [[region]]s of the [[world]] due to stronger updrafts.  These strong, severe, or even [[supercell]] thunderstorms usually occur in [[summer]], and don't require a cold front.   [[Image:Queensland HailStorm 260305.JPG|right|thumb|After a mild hailstorm in Brisbane, Australia - a subtropical region]]  Hail can do serious damage, notably to [[automobile]]s, [[skylight]]s, and [[glass]]-[[roof]]ed [[structure]]s.

At [[Crossbarry]] in 1921, 200 or so of Barry's men fought  a sizeable engagement with a British column of 1,200, escaping from the British encircling manouvre. In Dublin, the &quot;Squad&quot; and elements of the IRA Dublin Brigade were amalgamated into the &quot;Active Service Unit&quot;, under [[Oscar Traynor]], which tried to carry out at least three attacks on British troops a day. Usually, these consisted of shooting or grenade atacks on British patrols. Outside of Dublin and Munster, there were only isolated areas of intense activity. For instance, the [[county Longford]] IRA under [[Sean MacEoin]] carried out a number of well planned ambushes and successfully defended the village of [[Ballinalee]] in a three hour gun battle against Black and Tan reprisals. In [[Mayo]], large scale guerrilla action did break out until spring 1921, when two British forces were ambushed and mauled at [[Carrowkennedy ambush|Carrowkennedy]] and [[Tourmakeady]]. Elsewhere, fighting was more sporadic and less intense.   In [[Belfast]], the war had a character all of it own. The area had a Protestant and Unionist majority and IRA actions were responded to with ferocious reprisals agaisnt the Catholic population, including killings and the burning of many homes. The IRA in Belfast and the north generally, was therefore mostly involved in protecting the Catholic community from [[loyalists]] and state forces. The violence in Belfast alone, which continued long after the truce in the rest of the country, killed around 450 people, mostly civilians.  In April 1921, the IRA was again re-organised, in line with the [[Dail]]'s endorsement of its actions, along the lines of a regular army. [[Divisions]] were created based on region, with commanders being given responsability, in theory, for large geographical areas. In practice,this had little effect on the localised nature of the [[guerrilla warfare]].  By the end of the war, in July 1921, the IRA was very hard pressed by the deployment of more British troops into the most active areas and a chronic shortage of arms and ammunition. It has been estimated that the IRA had only about 3000 rifles (mostly captured from the British) during the war, with a larger number of [[shotguns]] and pistols. An ambitious plan to arms from [[Italy]] in 1921 collapsed when the money did not reach the arms dealers. Towards the end of the war, some [[Thompson submachine gun]]s were imported from the [[USA]], however 450 of these were intercepted by the American authorities and the remainder only reached Irleand shortly before th Truce.  By June 1921, Collins's assessment was that the IRA was within weeks, possibly even days, of collapse. It had few weapons or ammunition left. Moreover, alomst 5000 IRA men had been imprisoned or interned and over 500 killed. Collins and Mulcahy estimated that the number of effective guerrilla fighters was down to 2-3000.

Generated seq by model:-  narrative poetry; it refers to poems constructed from a sequence of rhyming pairs of [[iambic pentameter]] lines.  A frequently-cited example illustrating the use of heroic couplets is this passage from ''Cooper's Hill'' by [[John Denham (poet)|John Denham]], part of his description of the [[River Thames|Thames]]:  :O could I flow like thee, and make thy stream&lt;br&gt; :My great example, as it is my theme!&lt;br&gt; :Though deep, yet clear, though gentle, yet not dull,&lt;br&gt; :Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full.  The term &quot;heroic couplet&quot; is sometimes reserved for couplets that are largely ''closed'' and self-contained, as opposed to the [[enjambment|enjambed]] couplets of poets like [[John Donne]]. The greatest masters of the heroic couplet in English, thus defined, are generally considered to be [[John Dryden]] and [[Alexander Pope]]. Major poems in the closed couplet, apart from the works of Dryden and Pope, are [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[The Vanity of Human Wishes]]'', [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''[[The Deserted Village]]'', and [[John Keats]]'s ''[[Lamia]]''. The form was immensely popular in the 18th century. The looser type of couplet, with occasional enjambment, was one of the standard verse forms in medieval narrative poetry, largely because of the influence of the [[Canterbury Tales]].   English heroic couplets, especially in Dryden and his followers, are sometimes varied by the use of the occasional [[alexandrine]], or hexameter line, and triplet. Often these two variations are used together to heighten a climax. The breaking of the regular pattern of rhyming pentameter pairs brings about a sense of [[poetic closure]].  Here are three examples from Book IV of Dryden's translation of the ''[[Aeneid]]''.  ''Triplet'' :Nor let him then enjoy supreme command; :But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand,   :And lie unburied on the barren sand! :(ll. 890-892)  ''Alexandrine'' :Her lofty courser, in the court below, :Who his majestic rider seems to know,   :Proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground,   :And champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around. :(ll. 190-193)  ''Alexandrine and Triplet'' :My Tyrians, at their injurâd queenâs command,   :Had tossâd their fires amid the Trojan band;   :At once extinguishâd all the faithless name;   :And I myself, in vengeance of my shame, :Had fallân upon the pile, to mend the funâral flame. :(ll. 867-871)  [[Category:Poetic form]]</text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>Henry II of Saxony</title>     <id>14124</id>     <revision>       <id>15911701</id>       <timestamp>2004-06-11T16:41:33Z</timestamp>       <contributor>         <username>Timwi</username>         <id>13051</id>       </contributor>       <minor />       <comment>fix double-redirect</comment>       <text xml:space="preserve">#REDIRECT [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria]]</text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>Homosexuals</title>     <id>14126</id>     <revision>       <id>15911703</id>       <timestamp>2002-02-25T15:43:11Z</timestamp>       <contr>hcB_rpeEeo21o2oirpermhchtee|p

Generated seq by model:- naissance culture. Today she is often seen as a goddess of [[witchcraft]].   ==Representations== The earliest depictions of Hecate are single faced, not triplicate. Lewis Richard Farnell states: :''The evidence of the monuments as to the character and significance of Hekate is almost as full as that of the literature. But it is only in the later period that they come to express her manifold and mystic nature. Before the fifth century there is little doubt that she was usually represented as of single form like any other divinity, and it was thus that the [[Hesiod|Boeotian poet]] imagined her, as nothing in his verses contains any allusion to a triple formed goddess. The earliest known monument is a small terracotta found in Athens, with a dedication to Hekate (Plate XXXVIII. a), in writing of the style of the sixth century. The goddess is seated on a throne with a chaplet bound round her head; she is altogether without attributes and character, and the only value of this work, which is evidently of quite a general type and gets a special reference and name merely from the inscription, is that it proves the single shape to be her earlier from, and her recognition at Athens to be earlier than the Persian invasion.'' &lt;ref&gt;Lewis Richard Farnell, (1896). &quot;Hecate in Art&quot;, ''The Cults of the Greek States''. [[Oxford University Press]], [[Oxford]]. &lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] stated that Hecate was first depicted in triplicate by the sculptor [[Alkamenes]] in the Greek Classical period of the late 5th century. Some classical portrayals, such as the one illustrated below, show her as a triplicate goddess holding a torch. Others continue to depict her in singular form. In Egyptian-inspired Greek [[esotericism|esoteric writings]] connected with [[Hermes Trismegistus]], and in magical papyri of [[Late Antiquity]] she is described as having three heads: one dog, one [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] and one horse. Hecate's triplicity is expressed in a more Hellene fashion, with three bodies instead, where she is shown taking part in the battle with the Titans in the vast frieze of the great altar of Pergamum, now in Berlin. In the [[Argos|Argolid]], near the shrine of the Dioscuri, the 2nd-century CE traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] saw the temple of Hecate opposite the sanctuary of Eilethyia; &quot;The image is a work of [[Scopas]]. This one is of stone, while the bronze images opposite, also of Hekate, were made respectively by [[Polyclitus|Polycleitus]] and his brother Naucydes, son of Mothon. (''Description of Greece'' ii.22.7)  A [[4th century BCE]] marble relief from Crannon in Thessaly was dedicated by a race-horse owner. It shows Hecate, with a hound beside her, placing a wreath on the head of a mare. This statue is in the British Museum, inventory number 816. Her attendant and animal representation is of a bitch, and the most common form of offering was to leave meat at a crossroads. Sometimes dogs themselves were sacrificed to her (a good indication of her non-Hellenic ttoo  ahtu letaehorihh a ioath

Imaginary numbers were created in 1572 by [[Rafael Bombelli]].  At the time, such numbers were thought not to exist, much as zero and the negative numbers were sometimes regarded by some as fictitious or useless. Many other mathematicians were slow to believe in imaginary numbers at first, including [[Descartes]] who wrote about them in his ''[[La GÃ©omÃ©trie]]'', where the term was meant to be derogatory.  ==Definition==  Any [[complex number]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;a+bi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are [[real number]]s and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary unit]] with the property that:  :&lt;math&gt;i^2 = -1.\,&lt;/math&gt;  The number &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[real part]] of the complex number, and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary part]]. Although Descartes originally used the term &quot;imaginary number&quot; to mean what is currently meant by the term &quot;complex number&quot;, the term &quot;imaginary number&quot; today usually means a complex number with a [[real part]] equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, that is, a number of the form &lt;math&gt;bi&lt;/math&gt;. Note that, technically, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is considered to be a purely imaginary number: &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is the only complex number which is both real and purely imaginary.  ==Geometric interpretation==  Geometrically, imaginary numbers are found on the vertical axis of the [[complex number]] plane, allowing them to be presented orthogonal to the real axis.

These perspectives opposed or de-emphasized the importance of the [[rationality]] of human beings. Instead, they concentrated on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s &quot;[[noumenon|noumenal realm]]&quot;, or the experience of one's own existence.   Part of the movements involved claims that [[science]] was inferior to [[intuition]].  In this project, [[art]] was given an especially high place, as it was considered the gateway to the noumenon. Unfortunately, not all of the public at the time were involved in this movement and only the [[elite]] had access to the [[art]] (ie. a &quot;Mandarin elitism&quot;).  Some of the followers of this idea are [[Nietzsche]], [[Dostoevsky]], [[Bergson]], and [[Sorel]]. [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[existentialism]] grew out of these schools of thought.  ==See also== *[[Rationalism]]  {{philo-stub}} [[Category:Ethics]]  [[sk:Iracionalizmus]]</text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>Indonesia</title>     <id>14579</id>     <revision>       <id>42108852</id>       <timestamp>2006-03-03T21:59:05Z</timestamp>       <contributor>         <username>Klaam</username>         <id>840384</id>       </contributor>       <text xml:space="preserve">{{Infobox_Country| native_name = Republik Indonesia | common_name = Indonesia | image_flag = Flag_of_Indonesia.svg | image_coat = Coat_of_Indonesia.png | image_map = LocationIndonesia.png | national_motto = [[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]&lt;br&gt;([[Javanese language#Old Javanese|Old Javanese]]/[[Kawi language|Kawi]]: Unity in Diversity)&lt;br&gt; [[ideology|National ideology]]: [[Pancasila Indonesia | Pancasila]]| national_anthem = [[Indonesia Raya]] | officiala i ]e un]]aec t]] .hio]ee  s

Generated seq by model:- eposits of grey hematite are typically found in places where there has been standing water or mineral [[hot spring]]s, such as those in [[Yellowstone]]. The mineral can [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of water and collect in layers at the bottom of a lake, spring, or other standing water. But hematite can also occur without water, as the result of [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity.  [[Clay]]-sized hematite crystals can also occur as a secondary mineral formed by weathering processes in [[soil]], and along with other iron oxides or oxyhydroxides such as [[goethite]], is responsible for the red color of many tropical, ancient, or otherwise highly weathered soils.  The name hematite is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for blood, since sometimes hematite can be red, as in [[Rouge]], a powderized form of hematite. It shares this root with the word [[hemoglobin]]. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-transporting molecule in [[red blood cell]]s, the iron of which causes blood to be red. The color of hematite lends it well in use as a pigment.  [[Image:Rainbow_hematite_MG.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Rainbow Hematite from Brazil]]  Especially nice specimens of hematite come from [[England]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Australia]] and the [[Lake Superior]] region of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  Hematite is an [[antiferromagnetic]] material below the Morin transition at 260K, and a canted antiferromagnet or weakly [[ferromagnetic]] above the Morin transition. [http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/ES304/MODULES/MAG/NOTES/typesmag.html].  ==Hematite on Mars==  Hematite can be formed by aqueous processes, [[weathering]] processes, or without water. In 2004, NASA's [[Mars Exploration Rover Mission|Mars rover]] ''[[MER-B|Opportunity]]'' discovered small spheres believed to be made partly or mostly of hematite. The spheres are only a few millimeters in diameter and are believed to have formed as rock deposites under watery conditions billions of years ago when [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] was a wetter world. The rover used its instruments (a [[MÃ¶ssbauer spectrometer|MÃ¶ssbauer spectrometer]]) to test how the hematite found on Mars at Meridiani Planum was formed.  ==See also== *[[Iron ore]] *[[Iron oxide]] *[[List of minerals]]  ==External links== * [http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/opportunity/20040212a/07-ml-3-soil-mosaic-B019R1_br.jpg Mars spheres image]. * [http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/opportunity/20040219a/08-AY-3-shiny-B026R1_br.jpg Mars trench image showing a shiny texture of half-buried spheres] (dark line is equipment shadow)  [[Category:Oxide minerals]] [[Category:Iron minerals]]  [[ca:Hematites]] [[de:HÃ¤matit]] [[es:Hematita]] [[fr:HÃ©matite]] [[it:Ematite]] [[he:×××××]] [[lt:Hematitas]] [[nl:Hematiet]] [[ja:èµ¤éé±]] [[pl:Hematyt]] [[pt:Hematita]] [[fi:Hematiitti]]</text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>Holocene extinction event</title>     <id>14208</id>     <revision>       <id>40941614</id>       <timestamp>2006-02-24T00:41:49Z</timestamp>       <contributor>     EiwBiirecbECepnrttIeohs]ccue

The most prevalent are subtypes B (found predominantly in North America and Europe), A and D (found predominantly in Africa), and C (found predominantly in Africa and Asia) (Figure 5); these subtypes form branches in the phylogenetic tree representing the lineage of the M group of HIV-1 (Figure 4). Coinfection with distinct subtypes gives rise to circulating recombinant forms (CRFs).   In 2000, the last year in which an analysis of global subtype prevalence was made, 47.2% of infections worldwide were of subtype C, 26.7% were of subtype A/CRF02_AG, 12.3% were of subtype B, 5.3% were of subtype D, 3.2% were of CRF_AE, and the remaining 5.3% were composed of other subtypes and CRFs &lt;ref name=Osmanov&gt;  {{cite journal  | author=Osmanov S, Pattou C, Walker N, Schwardlander B, Esparza J; WHO-UNAIDS Network for HIV Isolation and Characterization. | title=Estimated global distribution and regional spread of HIV-1 genetic subtypes in the year 2000 | journal=Acquir.

Almost 95% of all HIV research currently taking place is focused on subtype B, while a few laboratories focus on other subtypes.  ==Treatment== HIV infection is a [[chronic]] infectious disease that can be treated, but not yet cured. There are effective means of preventing [[complication (medicine)|complications]] and delaying progression to [[AIDS]]. At the present time, not all persons infected with HIV have progressed to [[AIDS]], but it is generally believed that the majority will. People with HIV infection need to receive education about the disease and treatment so that they can be active partners in decision making with their health care provider.  A combination of several antiretroviral agents, termed Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy [[antiretroviral drug|HAART]], has been highly effective in reducing the number of HIV particles in the blood stream (as measured by a [[HIV test|blood test called the viral load]]). This can improve [[T-cell]] counts. This is not a cure for HIV, and people on [[antiretroviral drug|HAART]] with suppressed levels of HIV can still transmit the virus to others through sex or sharing of needles. There is good evidence that if the levels of HIV remain suppressed and the CD4 count remains greater than 200, then the quality and length of life can be significantly improved and prolonged. Improved antiretroviral inhibitors against proteins such as [[Reverse transcriptase]], [[HIV structure and genome#Integrase|Integrase]] and [[HIV structure and genome#Tat|Tat]] are being researched and developed. One of the most promising new therapies is a new class of drugs called [[fusion inhibitor|fusion or entry inhibitors]]. {{see details|Antiretroviral drug}}  [[Poss4==  S c    =  =CE*1 SA =C

Generated seq by model:- Hamar_kart.png]]| munwebpage=www.hamar.kommune.no| }} '''Hamar''' is a town and [[municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in the [[counties of Norway|county]] of [[Hedmark]], [[Norway]].  Hamar is located on the shores of [[MjÃ¸sa]], Norway's largest lake, and is the principal city of the [[Hedmark]] county. It is bordered to the northwest by [[Ringsaker]], to the north by [[Ãmot]], to the east by [[LÃ¸ten]], and on the south by [[Stange]].  ==History== Between [[500]]AD and [[1000 AD|1000]]AD, the farm Aker was probably one of the most important power centres in Norway, located just a few kilometres outside today's Hamar. After the christening of Norway in 1030, Hamar began to gain influence as a centre for trade and religion, until the episcopal representative [[Pope Adrian IV|Nikolaus Breakspear]] in [[1152]] founded Hamar Kaupangen as one of five dioceses in medieval Norway. It remained an important religious and political centre in Norway, organized around the cathedral and the bishop's manor until the [[Reformation|reformation]] in [[1536]], when it lost its status as a bishopric. The cathedral and manor were destroyed in the [[Northern Seven Years' War]] with [[Sweden]] in [[1567]], and in [[1568]] the [[Market town|market]] was disbanded, under pressure from citizens of [[Oslo]]. Since then, Hamar gradually lost its importance as a trading centre. The site of the medieval town fell into disrepair and was taken over by a farm.  ==The modern city==  The modern city of Hamar was founded a kilometer or so south of the medieval city in [[1849]] by [[King Oscar]] as a trading center. [[Image:hamar-walkingstreet.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Hamar's pedestrian street]] [[Image:Domkirkeruinene-Hamar.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Domkirkeruinene (cathedral ruins)]] The [[Hedmark museum]], located on [[Domkirkeodden]] is an important historical landmark in Hamar, an out-door museum with remains of the medieval church, in a protective glass housing, the episcopal fortress, and a collection of old farm houses.  The museum is a combined medieval, ethnological and archaeological museum and has received architectural prizes for its approach to conservation and exhibition.  It also houses a vast photographic archive for the Hedmark region. [[Image:Vikingskipet-Hamar.jpg|right|thumb|260px|The Viking Ship]] Hamar is also known for its indoor [[speed skating]] arena, the ''Olympia Hall'', better known as [[Vikingskipet Olympic Arena|Vikingskipet]] (&quot;The [[Viking]] ship&quot;) for its shape. It was built to host the speed skating competitions of the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] that were held in nearby [[Lillehammer]].  The centre of Hamar is the pedestrian walkway in the middle of town, with the library, cinema and farmer's market on Stortorget (the big square) on the western side, and Ãstre Torg (the eastern square) on the eastern side.  Hamar is an important [[railway]] junction between two different lines to [[Trondheim]]. [[RÃ¸rosbanen]], the old railway line, branches off from the mainline [[Dovrebanen]].

There is a growing population of Jews and Muslims in Italy, many of whom speak Hebrew and Arabic, respectively.  ==Notes== {{ent|1|Romanian}} According to Mitrica, an October 2005 Romanian report estimates that 1,061,400 Romanians are living in Italy, constituting 37.2% of 2.8 million immigrants in that country [http://www.evz.ro/eveniment/?news_id=201813] but it is unclear how the estimate was made, and therefore whether it should be taken seriously or not. {{ent|2|dialects}}See also (in Italian): ''L.

The Famine was at least fifty years in the making, due to the disastrous interaction of [[United Kingdom|British]] economic policy, destructive farming methods, and the unfortunate appearance of &quot;the Blight&quot; &amp;mdash;the [[potato fungus]] that almost instantly destroyed the primary food source for the majority population.  The immediate after-effects of The Famine continued until [[1851]]. The number of deaths is unrecorded, and various estimates suggest totals between 500,000 and more than one million in the five years from 1846. Some two million refugees are attributed to the Great Hunger (estimates vary), and much the same number of people emigrated to [[Great Britain]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]] (''see'' the [[Irish Diaspora]]).  The immediate effect on Ireland was devastating, and its long-term effects proved immense, permanently changing Irish culture and tradition. The Irish Potato Famine was the culmination of a social, biological, political and economic catastrophe, caused by both Irish and British factors, which would have sharp and lasting influences on the world.  ==The potato in Ireland== The potato contains considerable [[food energy]], and yet is very easy to cultivate.

Generated seq by model:- Treaty of Stralsund]]) and an effective trade monopoly in Scandinavia. They also waged vigorous campaign against pirates. Between [[1392]] and [[1440]] maritime trade of the League was in danger from raids of [[Victual Brothers]] and their descendants, a mighty [[brotherhood]] of [[privateer]]s hired in [[1392]] by [[Albert of Sweden|Albrecht of Mecklenburg]] against the Danish queen [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]]. Their monopoly was broken by the [[Dutch-Hanseatic War]] ([[1438]]-[[1441]]) where the merchants of Amsterdam sought to obtain free access to the Baltic and were ultimately successful. As an essential part of protecting their investment in trade and ships, the League trained [[Pilot (harbour)|pilot]]s and erected lighthouses.  Exclusive trade routes often came at a high price. In most foreign cities, the Hanse traders were confined to certain trading areas and to their own trading posts. They were seldom, if ever, allowed to interact with the local inhabitants, except in the matter of actual negotiation. Moreover, the power of the League was envied by many, merchant and noble alike. For example, in London there was continuing pressure from the local merchants for the Hanseatic League's privileges to be revoked. This tension was exacerbated by the refusal of the League to offer reciprocal arrangements to their English counterparts. The league's privileges were reconfirmed by [[King Edward IV]] in [[1474]] despite this hostility. This was at least in part thanks to the significant financial contribution the League made during [[The Wars of the Roses]]. A century later, in [[1597]], [[Queen Elizabeth I]] expelled the League from London and the [[Steelyard]] was closed in [[1598]]. The very existence of the League and its privileges and monopolies created economic and social tensions that often crept over into rivalry between League members.  ===Downfall=== The Hansa was not spared the economic crises of the late [[14th century]], but its eventual rivals were the [[Nation state|territorial states]], whether new or revived, and not just in the west: [[Poland]] triumphed over the [[Teutonic Knights]] in [[1466]]; [[Ivan III of Russia]] ended the entrepreneurial independence of Novgorod in [[1478]]. New vehicles of credit imported from [[Italy]] outpaced the Hansa economy, where silver coin changed hands rather than bills of exchange.  At the start of the 16th century, the League was in a weaker position than it had known for many years. The Baltic monopoly was being actively challenged by Dutch and English merchants. The rising [[Swedish Empire]] had taken possession of much of the Baltic. Denmark had regained control over its own trade, the Kontor in Novgorod had shut and the Kontor in Brugge was effectively defunct. The individual cities which made up the League had also started to put self interest before common good. Finally the political authority of the German princes was starting to grow and so constrain the indepence of action which the merchants and Hanseatic Towns had enjoyed.

Generated seq by model:- hool mathematics -- addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, geometry -- was known to educated people, though the notation was cumbersome: [[Roman numeral]]s and words were used, but no symbols: no plus sign, no equal sign, no zero and no use of ''x'' as an unknown. Almost all of the mathematics now taught in college had yet to be discovered, or was known only to the small and isolated mathematical community in [[India]].  Contact with [[Islam]]ic scholars brought to Europe knowledge of the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral]]s. In the [[12th century]] [[Robert of Chester]] translated [[Al-Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah]] into Latin. The works of [[Aristotle]] were rediscovered, first in Arabic and later in Greek. Of particular importance to the development of mathematics was the rediscovery of a collection of Aristotle's logical writing, compiled in the [[1st century]], known as the [[Organon]].  The reawakened desire for new knowledge sparked a renewed interest in mathematics. [[Fibonacci]], in the early [[13th century]], produced the first original mathematics in Europe since the time of [[Eratosthenes]], a gap of more than a thousand years. But it was only from the late [[16th century]] that European mathematicians began to make advances without precedent anywhere in the world, so far as is known today.  The first of these was the general solution of [[cubic equation]]s, generally credited to [[Scipione del Ferro]] circa [[1510]], but first published in [[Cardan|Cardan's]] ''Ars magna''. It was quickly followed by [[Lodovico Ferrari|Lodovico Ferrai's]] solution of the general [[quartic equation]].  From this point on, mathematical discovery came swiftly, and combined with advances in science, to their mutual benefit. In the landmark year [[1543]], [[Copernicus]] published ''De revolutionibus'', asserting that the Earth traveled around the Sun, and [[Vesalius]] published ''De humani corporis fabrica'', treating the human body as a collection of organs.  By century's end, thanks to [[Regiomontanus]] (1436 - 1476) and [[FranÃ§ois Vieta]] (1540 - 1603), among others, mathematics and science was written using Hindu-Arabic numerals and in a form not too different from the elegant symbolism used today.  ==17th century== The [[17th century]] saw an unprecedented explosion of mathematical and scientific ideas that not only fascinated philosophers but had industrial applications that began to make major changes in the way people lived.  [[Copernicus]], a Pole, had written that planets orbit the Sun. [[Galileo]], an Italian, observed the moons of Jupiter in orbit about that planet, using a telescope based on a toy imported from Holland. [[Tycho Brahe]], a Dane, had gathered an enormous quantity of mathematical data describing the positions of the planets in the sky. His student, [[Johannes Kepler]], a German, began to work with this data. In part because he wanted to help Kepler in his calculations, [[Lord Napier]], in Scotland, invented [[natural logarithm]]s.  Kepler succeeded in formulating mathematical laws of planetary motion. The [p   h.a h cTW i   I]F  -i[I  '

Generated seq by model:- state]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the [[United States]]. The state's [[capital]] and largest city is [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]]. Residents are called &quot;Idahoans.&quot; Idaho was admitted to the Union on [[July 3]], [[1890]], as the 43rd state.  According to the United States Census Bureau in [[2004]] Idaho had an estimated population of 1,393,262. The state's postal abbreviation is '''ID'''. Idaho is nicknamed the '''Gem State''' because of its abundance of natural resources. The state motto is '''Esto Perpetua''' ([[Latin]] for &quot;Let it be perpetual&quot;).  ==Name== Idaho has a very unusual name. It is perhaps the only state to be named as the result of a [[hoax]]. When a name was being selected for new territory, eccentric lobbyist [[George M. Willing]] suggested &quot;Idaho,&quot; which he claimed was a Native American term meaning &quot;gem of the mountains&quot;. It was later revealed Willing had made up the name himself, and the original Idaho territory was re-named [[Colorado]] because of it. Eventually the controversy was forgotten, and modern-day Idaho was given the made-up name when the [[Idaho Territory]] was formally created in [[1863]].  == History == {{splitsection|History of Idaho}}  Humans may have been present in the Idaho area as long as 14,500 years ago. Excavations at Wilson Butte Cave near [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]] in [[1959]] revealed evidence of human activity, including arrowheads, that rank among the oldest dated artifacts in [[North America]]. Later [[Native Americans in the United States|native American]] tribes predominant the area included the [[Nez Perce]] in the north and the Northern and Western [[Shoshone]] in the south.  By contrast, Idaho was the last of the 50 states explored by people of European descent. The [[Lewis and Clark]] expedition entered present-day Idaho on [[August 12]], [[1805]], at the [[Lemhi Pass]]. The first expedition to enter southern Idaho is believed to be a group led by Wilson Price Hunt, which navigated the [[Snake River]] while attempting to blaze an all-water trail westward from [[St. Louis, Missouri]], to [[Astoria, Oregon]], in [[1811]] and [[1812]]. At that time, approximately 8,000 Native Americans lived in the region.   [[Fur trading]] and [[missionary]] work attracting the first settlers to the region. In [[1809]], [[Kullyspell House]], the first white-owned establishment and first trading post in Idaho, was constructed. In [[1836]], [[Henry H. Spalding]] established a mission near [[Lapwai]], where he printed the Northwest's first book, established Idaho's first school, developed its first irrigation system, and grew the state's first potatoes. [[Narcissa Whitman]] and [[Eliza Hart Spalding]] were the first white women to cross the continental divide (South Pass).  During this time the Idaho region was part of an unorganized territory known as [[Oregon Country]], claimed by both the United States and [[Great Britain]]. The United States gained undisputed jurisdiction over the region in the [[Oregon Treaty]] of [[1846]]. The originarde  t 8 . .ge  Cd   a i.aBl,s

On the other hand, God has existed forever. Arius felt that any attempt to recognize the deity of Christ would blur the lines between Christianity and the Pagan religions. If Christianity recognized two separate gods, the Father and Jesus, it would become a polytheistic religion.  Although most writings of Arius were destroyed by the early Catholic Church and the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], we can infer from [[Athanasius]]' arguments against Arius some idea of the movement.  Basically, Arius was a leader of Christians who had a very particular understanding of the early [[trinitarianism]] movement, reflecting the divine nature of Christ.  Arius' hypothesis, to our knowledge, was that Jesus was created by God (as in, &quot;There was a time when the Son was not&quot;), and hence, was secondary to God. His primary proof text was John 17:3. Athanasius' position was that Jesus was and always had been divine, and had a divine nature along with the Father and the Holy Spirit.  ====Gnosticism==== A Greek philosophical/religious movement known as [[Gnostic]]ism had developed at roughly the same time as Christianity. Many followers of this movement ([[Valentinius]] being one of the most well-known) were also Christians, and taught a synthesis of the two belief systems. This produced a major controversy in the early church.  Gnostic interpretations differed from mainstream Christianity because orthodox Christians took the literal interpretation of the [[Gospels]]  as the correct one, whereas Gnostics tended to read them as [[allegory]]; thus the orthodox branch attracted greater numbers of adherents. This was observed quite early, for example, the second century [[Celsus]] (whose words are preserved in [[Origen]]'s ''Contra Celsum'', a text designed against Celsus) states that Christianity :''continues to spread amongst the vulgar, nay one can even say it spreads because of its vulgarity, and the illiteracy of its adherents. And while there are a few moderate, reasonable, and intelligent people who are inclined to interpret its beliefs allegorically, yet it thrives in its purer form amongst the ignorant''  === Competing religions === Christianity was not the only religion seeking and finding converts in the 1st century.

The provinces are subdivided into [[Regencies_of_Indonesia|regencies]] and [[Cities_of_Indonesia|cities]], which are in turn split up in [[sub-district]]s.  The provinces are:  [[Bali]], [[Bangka-Belitung]], [[Banten]], [[Bengkulu]], [[Central Java]], [[Central Kalimantan]], [[Central Sulawesi]], [[East Java]], [[East Kalimantan]], [[East Nusa Tenggara]], [[South Sumatra]], [[Gorontalo]], [[Jambi]], [[Lampung]], [[Maluku (Indonesian province)|Maluku]], [[North Maluku]], [[North Sulawesi]], [[North Sumatra]], [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]] (Irian Jaya), [[Riau]], [[Riau Kepulauan]], [[South East Sulawesi]], [[South Kalimantan]], [[South Sulawesi]], [[West Irian Jaya]], [[West Java]], [[West Kalimantan]], [[West Nusa Tenggara]], [[West Sulawesi]], [[West Sumatra]]  The special territories (''daerah istimewa'') are [[Aceh]] (or ''Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam'') and [[Yogyakarta]]. Special territories have more autonomy from the central government than other provinces, and so have unique legislative privileges: the Acehnese government has the right to create an independent legal system, and instituted a form of ''[[sharia]]'' (Islamic Law) in 2003; Yogyakarta remains a sultanate whose sultan (currently the wildly popular Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono X) is the territory's ''de facto'' governor for life.  The special capital region is [[Jakarta]]. Though Jakarta is a single city, it is administered much as any other Indonesian province. For example, Jakarta has a governor (instead of a mayor), and is divided into several sub-regions with their own administrative systems.  [[East Timor]] was a province of Indonesia from [[1975]], when it was annexed by military invasion, until Indonesia relinquished sovereignty in [[1999]] after years of bitter fighting against East Timor [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] and abuses by Indonesian military forces against the East Timorese civilians. Following a period of [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor|transitional administration by the UN]], it became an [[independent state]] in [[2002]].  ==Geography== [[Image:Id-map.png|thumb|300px|right|Map of Indonesia]] {{Main|Geography of Indonesia}}  Indonesia's [[Islands of Indonesia|18,108 islands]], of which about 6,000 are inhabited, are scattered around the [[equator]], giving the country a [[tropical climate]].

Indonesia borders Malaysia on the island of Borneo ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: [[Kalimantan]]), Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea and [[East Timor]] on the island of [[Timor]]. In addition to the capital city of Jakarta, principal cities of high population include [[Surabaya]], [[Bandung]], [[Medan]], [[Palembang]], and [[Semarang]].

Generated seq by model:- AtomOrbitals2.png|An image with more orbitals]] is also available (up to higher numbers ''n'' and l).  Note the number of black lines that occur in each but the first orbital. These are &quot;[[nodal line]]s&quot; (which are actually  [[nodal surface]]s in three dimensions). Their total number is always equal to ''n'' &amp;minus; 1, which is the sum of the number of radial nodes (equal to ''n'' - ''l'' - 1) and the number of angular nodes (equal to ''l'').  == Features going beyond the SchrÃ¶dinger solution ==  There are several important effects that are neglected by the SchrÃ¶dinger equation and which are responsible for certain small but measurable deviations of the real spectral lines from the predicted ones:  * Although the effective speed of the electron is only 1/10th of the [[speed of light]] (when ''l'' &gt; 0) there is an increase in the electron's mass, as predicted by [[special relativity]].  For heavier elements, this is more significant (see [http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtut/atomic/qprimer/#Q26]). * The spin of the electron has a [[magnetic moment]] attached to it. Even when there is no external [[magnetic field]], within the [[inertial frame]] of the moving electron the electric field of the nucleus partly acts like a magnetic field. This effect is also explained by special relativity, and it leads to the so-called ''[[spin-orbit coupling]]'', i.e. an influence of the electron's [[orbital motion (quantum)|orbital motion]] around the nucleus onto its [[spin (physics)|spin]].  Both of these features (and more) are incorporated in the relativistic [[Dirac equation]], whose predictions come still closer to experiment. It can still be solved exactly for the hydrogen atom. The resulting states now must be classified by the [[Total angular momentum quantum number|total angular momentum number]] ''j'' (arising through the coupling between [[electron spin]] and [[orbital angular momentum]]). States of the same j and the same n are still degenerate.  * There are always [[vacuum fluctuation]]s of the [[electromagnetic field]], according to quantum mechanics. This means in particular that the electron undergoes a kind of &quot;jitter&quot; motion. As a consequence, the degeneracy between states of the same j but different l is lifted. This has been demonstrated in the famous [[Lamb-Rutherford experiment]] and was the starting point for the development of the theory of [[Quantum electrodynamics]] (which is able to deal with these vacuum fluctuations and employs the famous [[Feynman diagram]]s for approximations using [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]). This effect is now called [[Lamb shift]]  For these developments, it was essential that the solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom could be worked out exactly, such that any experimentally observed deviation had to be taken seriously as a signal of failure of the theory.  {{Isotope|element=[[Hydrogen]] |lighter=(no lighter isotopes) |heavier=[[Hydrogen-2]] |before=See [[proton emission]] |after=Stable }}  ==References== *[hicm  Te ''tToTohoa   M< a aao

Generated seq by model:- 000 BC]].[http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/03/stories/2005040301931400.htm] If the earlier dates are correct, then perhaps, as historians such as [[Florian Cajori]] have claimed, [[Pythagoras]] traveled to India and learned mathematics there. But if the later date is correct, then Indian mathematics may have benefited from contact with Greece following the invasion of [[Alexander]]. It is also possible that the two mathematical traditions developed independently, which is the view currently supported by most scholars.  After the onset of the [[Iron Age]], the progress of Indian mathematics is fairly continuous until the [[16th century|16th century AD]], but it can be divided into roughly two periods of development. This section summarizes the period between [[800 BC]] and [[200 BC]], when Indian mathematics was not studied for the sole purpose of science, but there are still advanced mathematics papers scattered throughout a large body of Indian texts from this period (many are of uncertain date and authorship, however, and do not follow a serious mathematical tradition).  The [[Yajurveda|Yajur-Veda]] composed by [[900 BC]], first explained the concept of numeric [[infinity]]. [[Yajnavalkya]] (circa [[900 BC|900]]-[[800 BC]]) computed the value of [[Ï]] to 2 decimal places. The [[Sulba Sutras]] (circa [[800 BC|800]]-[[600 BC]]) were [[geometry]] texts that first used [[irrational numbers]], [[prime numbers]], the [[rule of three (mathematics)|rule of three]] and [[cube root]]s; computed the [[square root]] of 2 to five decimal places; gave the method for [[squaring the circle]]; solved [[linear equation]]s and [[quadratic equations]]; discovered [[Pythagorean triples]] algebraically and gave a statement and numerical proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].  The [[linguist]] [[PÄá¹ini|Panini]] formulated the [[grammar]] rules for [[Sanskrit]] in the [[5th century BC]]. His notation was similar to modern mathematical notation, and used metarules, [[transformation]]s, and [[recursion]]s with such sophistication that his grammar had the [[computing]] power equivalent to a [[Turing machine]]. Panini's work is also the forerunner to modern [[formal language theory]] (precursor to [[computing]]), while the [[Panini-Backus form]] used by most modern [[programming language]]s is also significantly similar to Panini's grammar rules. [[Pingala]] ([[4th century BC|4th]]-[[3rd century BC]]) invented the [[binary numeral system|binary number system]], [[Fibonacci series]] and [[Pascal's triangle]], and also used a dot to denote [[0 (number)|zero]] and described the formation of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The works of Panini and Pingala were foundational to the development of [[computing]].  ==Greek and Hellenistic mathematics (550 BC - 200 BC)== {{main|Greek mathematics}} Greek mathematics studied before the [[Hellenistic period]] refers only to the mathematics of [[Greece]].

Humans acquire this capacity at about four and a half years of age, whereas the bonobo, gorilla and chimpanzee never seem to do so. However, without the ability to test whether early members of the Homininae (such as ''[[Homo erectus]]'', ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'', or even the australopithecines) had a theory of mind, it is difficult to ignore similarities seen in their living cousins. Despite an apparent lack of real culture and significant physiological differences, some say that the orangutan may also satisfy these criteria. These scientific debates take on political significance for advocates of [[Great Ape personhood]].  In [[2002]], a 6&amp;ndash;7 million year old [[fossil]] [[skull]] nicknamed &quot;ToumaÃ¯&quot; by its discoverers, and formally classified as ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]'', was discovered in [[Chad]] and is possibly the earliest hominid [[fossil]] ever found. In addition to its age, ToumaÃ¯, unlike the 3&amp;ndash;4 million year younger [[gracile australopithecine]] dubbed &quot;[[Australopithecus afarensis|Lucy]]&quot;, has a relatively flat face without the prominent snout seen on other pre-''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' hominids. Some researchers have made the suggestion that this previously unknown species may in fact be a direct ancestor of modern humans (or at least closely related to a direct ancestor). Others contend that one fossil is not enough to make such a claim because it would overturn the conclusions of over 100 years of [[anthropology|anthropological]] study. A report on this finding was published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on [[July 11]], [[2002]]. While some scientists claim that it is merely the skull of a female gorilla, others have called it the most important hominin fossil since ''Australopithecus''.&lt;br clear=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;  == Classification == [[Image:Hominidae.PNG|300px|thumb|right|Hominoid family tree]] [[Image:Orang.gorilla.skulls.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Skulls of an orangutan and a gorilla]] * '''Family Hominidae''': humans and other great apes ** Subfamily [[Orangutan|Ponginae]] *** Genus ''[[Orangutan|Pongo]]'' **** [[Bornean Orangutan]], ''Pongo pygmaeus'' **** [[Sumatran Orangutan]], ''Pongo abelii'' ** Subfamily [[Homininae]] *** Tribe [[Gorilla|Gorillini]] **** Genus ''[[Gorilla]]'' ***** [[Western Gorilla]], ''Gorilla gorilla''  ***** [[Eastern Gorilla]], ''Gorilla beringei''  *** Tribe [[Hominini]] **** Genus ''[[chimpanzee|Pan]]'' ***** [[Common Chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes'' ***** [[Bonobo]] or Pygmy Chimpanzee, ''Pan paniscus'' **** Genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' ***** [[Human]], ''Homo sapiens''  == See also == {{Commonscat|Hominidae}} {{3d commons}} {{Wikispecies|Hominidae}} {{Wikibookspar|Dichotomous Key|Hominidae}} * [[Ape extinction]] * [[Declaration on Great Apes]] * [[Evolution of Homo sapiens]] * [[Evolutionary neuroscience]] * [[Graphical timeline of human evolution]] * [[Great a    TB[  21 H[ [TTgCAba -  B

Generated seq by model:- al traditions have disputed the primacy of Shiva over Vishnu and ''vice versa''. Again &quot;henotheism&quot; is a loose term covering complex traditions and disputes. The period of Hinduism that most closely corresponded to henotheism as MÃ¼ller understood it was the early Vedic period (before [[1000s BCE|1000 BCE]] within the four preliminary Vedas) and even that is disputed by some scholars, most notably the great Hindu mystic [[Aurobindo Ghosh]].  ===Christianity=== Although most Christians adamantly label themselves as [[monotheism|monotheists]], some argue that [[Christianity]] is properly a form of henotheism. Most forms of Christianity include the belief in a [[Godhead (Christianity)|Christian Godhead]] consisting of [[God the Father]], [[Jesus]], and the [[Holy Spirit]], with God the Father being dominant &quot;actor&quot; and &quot;creator&quot; &amp;ndash; though most Christians reject the view that God the Father is supreme over Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. However, [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] Christians strongly reject the view that the three persons of the Godhead are three distinct gods. Rather, they describe the three persons as having a single &quot;substance&quot;, thus counting as one god. The [[Council of Nicea]] (325 C.E.) affirmed that God was &quot;One Substance (Greek ''Ousia'') and three Persona (Greek ''[[Hypostasis]]'')&quot;.   The Christian Trinity, like the Classical Pagan Hypostasis and Hindu [[Trimurti]], has an impersonal divine substance as its unifying principle.  In addition, many Christians believe in what some consider to be a &quot;pantheon&quot; of [[angel]]s, [[demon]]s, and/or [[Saint]]s that are inferior to the [[Trinity]]. Christians do not label these beings as &quot;gods&quot;, although they are attributed with supernatural powers, and are sometimes the object of prayer.  When Christianity was adopted by Greco-Roman pagans or African slaves, the new converts often [[Saint#Historicity|attributed to these saints features]] of their previous polytheistic figures. In some cases, these beliefs have developed out of the Catholic church and form [[syncretism]]s like [[Santeria]]. (These beliefs are somewhat similar to [[Hinduism]] which distinguishes between God in the form of [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]], and [[deva]]s which are subordinate to God and who supervise forces of nature such as [[Agni]] (i.e., [[fire]]) or [[Vayu]] (i.e., [[wind]].)   Some [[non-trinitarian]] Christian denominations are more clearly henotheistic:  *Christian [[Gnosticism]] is generally henotheistic.  *In addition, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (Mormonism, or the LDS Church) views the members of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Christian Godhead]] as three distinct beings, where [[God the Father]] is supreme. Though not explicitly mentioned in cannonical LDS scripture, some [[Latter Day Saint]]s also infer the existence of numerous other [[god]]s and [[goddess]]es who have no direct relevance to this Earth or humanity.

The constitution was promulgated on [[January 1]], [[1948]].  == Division of powers == The [[1948]] Constitution established a bicameral [[parliament]], with a lower and an upper chamber (respectively [[Chamber of Deputies]] and [[Italian Senate|Senate]]), a separate judiciary branch, and an executive branch composed of a Council of Ministers (cabinet), headed by the president of the council ([[prime minister]]). The government depends on confidence from each branch of the parliament, and has in turn the power to make [[decree]]s.

It also removed the [[armed forces]], which had run the government since the days of [[Houari BoumÃ©diÃ¨nne]], from a designated role in the operation of the government. Among the scores of parties that sprang up under the new constitution, the militant [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS) was the most successful, winning more than 50% of all votes cast in [[municipal]] elections in June [[1990]] as well as in first stage of national legislative elections held in December [[1991]].  The surprising first round of success for the fundamentalist FIS party in the December 1991 balloting caused the army to intervene, crack down on the FIS, and postpone the subsequent elections. The fundamentalist response has resulted in a continuous low-grade civil conflict with the secular state apparatus, which nonetheless has allowed elections featuring pro-government and moderate religious-based parties. The FIS's armed wing, the [[Islamic Salvation Army]], disbanded in January [[2000]] and many armed militants of other groups surrendered under an [[amnesty]] program designed to promote national reconciliation. Nevertheless, small numbers of armed militants persist in confronting government forces and carrying out isolated attacks on villages and other types of terrorist attacks.

Generated seq by model:- cles such as [[human sexuality]], [[heterosexuality]], and [[homosexuality]].''   [[Sexual activity]] in [[human]]s is an [[Instinct|instinctive]] form of [[physical intimacy]]. It may be performed for the purposes of [[reproduction]], spiritual [[transcendence]], expressing [[affection]], and/or having fun and enjoying oneself (known in this context as &quot;sexual gratification&quot;).  [[libido|The desire to have sex]] is one of the [[motivation|basic drives]] of human behavior. Every animal species, and every human culture, has a range of conduct used in [[courtship]], [[intimacy]], and [[sexual activity]].   '''Human sexual behavior''' is therefore, the behaviors that [[human being]]s use, when seeking sexual or relational partners, gaining approval of possible partners, forming [[relationship]]s, showing [[affection]], and [[mating]].   It covers at least two major areas: [[anthropology]] (common or acepted practices across different cultures), and [[information]]al (background which is useful to individuals who may be engaged in, or considering, sexual activity)   ==Aspects of human sexual behavior==  ===Sexuality and sensuality===  There is no clear borderline between the sexual and nonsexual enjoyment of [[touching]] someone else's body. For example, [[holding hands]] may or may not have a sexual connotation, depending on [[culture]], situation and other factors. Although the most common form of [[heterosexuality | heterosexual]] [[sexual intercourse]] is universally regarded as sexual contact, there is a wide range of other sexual behaviors that may or may not be socially, legally, or ethically considered as ''sexual relations''. The distinction between the sexual and the nonsexual becomes relevant in judging appropriate behavior, in either a social setting or in the eyes of the law.  Some criteria that may be applied are: *the body parts involved (see also [[intimate parts]]) *physical signs of [[sexual arousal]] *subjective [[feeling]]  Enjoying touching someone else's body implies enjoying one's own body also; the latter may also happen without another person; enjoying one's own body also may or may not be of a sexual nature. If it is, it is called [[autoeroticism]].  The whole of one's sexual activities (including [[wet dream|erotic dreams]] and waking sexual [[fantasy|fantasies]] and [[daydream]]s) is called one's '''sex life'''.  === Desire and fantasy === '''Sexual desire''' or '''[[libido]]''' is the desire for sexual behavior. Most people focus their sexual desire on someone that they have a sexual relationship with, or would desire to have a sexual relationship with. See also [[sexual arousal]], [[sexual orientation]].  Many people enjoy fantasizing about, or reading or viewing, or seeing depictions of, [[sexual fantasies]] that they may not wish to engage in themselves, or that they would be unable to engage in themselves; see [[pornography]] and [[erotica]].  === Sexual relationships === Opinions and [[norm]]s vary about whether an emotional bond of a certain intensity and durability should be ai sm tta mp e t s e| d=au|cw-'

Generated seq by model:- is supreme. Though not explicitly mentioned in cannonical LDS scripture, some [[Latter Day Saint]]s also infer the existence of numerous other [[god]]s and [[goddess]]es who have no direct relevance to this Earth or humanity. ''See'' [[Godhead (Mormonism)]]. Though not explicitly discussed in canonical scripture, some [[Latter Day Saint]]s also acknowledge a [[Heavenly Mother]] in addition to [[God the Father]].  However, Mormons worship one God; this view is most easily described as worshipping God the Father ''through'' the conduit of the Son, Jesus Christ. Whereas other Christians speak of &quot;One God in Three Persons,&quot; the LDS scripture speaks instead of three persons in one God. See the [[Book of Mormon]]'s Mosiah 15:4 [http://scriptures.lds.org/mosiah/15/4#4] (&quot;they are one God&quot;), and LDS interpretation of John 17:11 [http://scriptures.lds.org/john/17] (Jesus asks the Father in prayer that his disciples &quot;may be one, ''as we are''&quot;).  ===Israelite Beliefs and Judaism=== It is generally uncontroversial that many of the Iron Age religions found in the land of Israel were henotheistic in practice.  For example, the [[Moab|Moabites]] worshipped the god, [[Chemosh]], the [[Edom|Edomites]], [[Qaus]], both of whom were part of the greater [[Canaan|Canaanite]] pantheon, headed by the chief god, [[El (Canaanite god)|El]].  The Canaanite pantheon consisted of El and [[Asherah|Asherat]] as the chief deities, with 70 sons who were said to rule over each of the nations of the earth.  These sons were the national gods worshipped within each region.  More recently, M.S. Smith's synthesis of the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] religion in the Iron Age has put forward the case that it, like those around it, was also henotheistic.  The discovery of artifacts at Kuntillet 'Ajrud and Khirbet El-Qom have arguably shown that in at least some sections of Israelite society, [[Yahweh]] and Asherah were believed to coexist as a divine couple.  Further evidence of an understanding of Yahweh existing within the Canaanite pantheon derives from [[syncretism|syncretistic]] [[Mythology|myths]] found within the [[Hebrew Bible]] itself.  Various battles between Yahweh and [[Leviathan]], [[Mot]], the [[tannin|tanninim]], and [[Yamm]] are already attested in the 14th century B.C.E. texts found at [[Ugarit]] (ancient Ras-Shamra).  In some cases, Yahweh had replaced Baal, and in others, he had taken El's roles.  According to Genesis, [[Abraham]] is revered as the one who overcame the idol worship of his family and surrounding people by recognizing the Hebrew God and establishing a covenant with him and creating the foundation of what has been called by scholars &quot;[[Ethical]] [[Monotheism]]&quot;. The first of the [[Ten commandments]] can be interpreted to forbid the Children of Israel from worshiping any other god but the one true God who had revealed himself at Mount Sinai and given them the [[Torah]], however it can also be read as henotheistic, since it states that they should have &quot;no other gods before me&quot;, not that t evosa /B B R.    gwP 23C&w pt

Generated seq by model:- es. It became highly successful, with circulation surpassing 100,000 every week.  Tintin had always been credited as simply &quot;by HergÃ©&quot;, without mention of Edgar Pierre Jacobs and HergÃ©'s other assistants. As Jacobs' contribution to the production of the strip increased, he began demanding a joint credit. HergÃ© refused and ended their hitherto fruitful collaboration. Jacobs then went on to produce his own comics for ''Tintin magazine'', including the widely-acclaimed ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]''.  ===Personal crises=== The increased demands which ''Tintin magazine'' placed on HergÃ© began to take their toll. In [[1949]], while working on the new version of ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'' (the first version had been left unfinished by the outbreak of [[World War II]]), HergÃ© suffered a nervous breakdown and was forced to take an abrupt four month-long break. He suffered another breakdown in early [[1950]], while working on ''[[Destination Moon (Tintin)|Destination Moon]]''.  In order to lighten HergÃ©'s workload, the HergÃ© Studios was set up on [[April 6]], [[1950]]. The studio employed a variety of assistants to help HergÃ© in producing the adventures of Tintin. Foremost amongst these was the artist [[Bob De Moor]], who would collaborate with HergÃ© on the remaining Tintin adventures, filling in details and backgrounds such as the spectacular [[Moon|lunar]] [[landscape]]s in ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]''. With the aid of the studio, HergÃ© managed to produce ''[[The Calculus Affair]]'' (regarded by some as his most polished work) in [[1954]], followed by ''[[The Red Sea Sharks]]'' in [[1956]].  [[Image:Tintinautibet.gif|right|thumb|''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'' ([[1958]])]]  By the end of this period, his personal life was again in crisis. His marriage with Germaine was breaking apart after twenty-five years; he had fallen in love with Fanny Vlaminck, a young artist who had recently joined the HergÃ© Studios. Furthermore, he was plagued by recurring [[nightmare]]s filled with whiteness. He consulted a Swiss [[psychoanalyst]], who advised him to give up working on Tintin. Instead, he launched into ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', possibly the most powerful of the Tintin stories.  Published in ''Tintin magazine'' from September [[1958]] to November [[1959]], ''Tintin in Tibet'' sent Tintin to the [[Himalaya]] in search of [[Chang Chong-Chen]], the Chinese boy he had befriended in ''[[The Blue Lotus]]''. The adventure allowed HergÃ© to confront his nightmares by filling the book with austere [[Alpine climate | alpine]] landscapes, giving the adventure a powerfully spacious setting. The normally rich cast of characters was pared to a minimum - Tintin, Captain Haddock, and the [[Sherpa (people)|sherpa]] Tharkey - as the story focused on Tintin's dogged search for Chang. HergÃ© came to regard this highly personal and emotionally riveting Tintin adventure as his favorite. The completion of the story seemed also to signal an end to his problems: he was no longer troubled by nightmares, divorced Germaine in [[1975]] (they had separam aotrboiw   s csttsiywtsr  ta

Generated seq by model:- d Ibsen became very disenchanted with life in Norway. In [[1864]] he left Oslo and went to [[Italy]] in self-imposed exile. He was not to return to his native land for the next 27 years, and when he returned it was to be as a noted playwright, however controversial.  His next play, ''[[Brand (play)|Brand]]'' ([[1865]]), was to bring him the critical acclaim he sought, along with a measure of financial success, as was his next play, ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' ([[1867]]), to which [[Edvard Grieg]] famously composed the [[incidental music]].  With success, he became more confident and began to introduce more and more his own beliefs and judgments into the drama, exploring what he termed the &quot;drama of ideas&quot;. His next series of plays are often considered his Golden Age, when he entered the height of his power and influence, becoming the center of dramatic controversy across Europe.  Ibsen moved from Italy to [[Dresden]], [[Germany]] in [[1868]]. Here he spent years writing the play he himself regarded as his main work, ''[[Emperor and Galilean]]'' ([[1873]]), dramatizing the life and times of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]. But although Ibsen himself always looked back on this play as the cornerstone of his entire works, very few shared his opinion. And his next works would be much more acclaimed.  [[Image:Ibsen-Dresden.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Portrait from around 1870]] Ibsen moved to [[Munich]] in [[1875]] and published ''[[A Doll's House]]'' in [[1879]]. The play is a scathing criticism of the traditional roles of men and women in Victorian marriage.  Ibsen followed ''A Doll's House'' with ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' ([[1881]]), another scathing commentary on Victorian morality, in which a widow reveals to her pastor that she has hidden the evils of her marriage for its duration. The pastor had advised her to marry her then fiancÃ© despite his philandering, and she did so in the belief that her love would reform him. But she was not to receive the result she was promised. Her husband's philandering continued right up until his death, and the result is that her son is syphilitic. Even the mention of [[venereal disease]] was scandalous, but to show that even a person who followed society's ideals of morality had no protection against it, that was beyond scandalous. Hers was not the noble life which Victorians believed would result from fulfilling one's duty rather than following one's desires. Those idealized beliefs were only the ''Ghosts'' of the past, haunting the present.  Society's criticism of Ibsen was raised to a fever pitch at this point, but Society itself was losing its control over the mass of people, most of whom didn't live in the rarefied air of the Victorian Gentleman. They wanted to see Ibsen's plays because he showed what so many of them already knew to be the reality. The tide had turned.  In ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' ([[1882]]), Ibsen went even further. Before, controversial elements were important and even pivotal components of the action, but they were on the small scale of individuat- hdA dspehi m-   ia   [.e ua

The first two batters faced by [[Nolan Ryan]] in his career were Mathews and Aaron, on [[September 11]], [[1966 in sports|1966]].  Neither of them struck out against Ryan.  In the first game of a [[double header]] against the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] on [[May 10]], [[1967 in sports|1967]], Aaron hit his only [[Inside-the-park home run|inside the park home run]] off [[Jim Bunning]].  Aaron hit a conventional home run in the second game of the double header off of [[Larry Jackson]].  Aaron hit his 500th home run on [[July 14]], [[1968 in sports|1968]] off [[Mike McCormick]] of the [[San Francisco Giants]] at [[Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium|Fulton County Stadium]].  Aaron was just the 8th player to reach the milestone and he did it exactly one year after his former teammate [[Eddie Mathews]] did it with the [[Houston Astros]].  At the time, Aaron was the second youngest player to ever do so at 34 years, five months and nine days, a year and a half older than the youngest player to do so, [[Jimmie Foxx]].  On [[July 30]], [[1969 in sports|1969]] Aaron hit his 537th home run to move into 3rd place on the career home run list, past [[Mickey Mantle]] and behind only [[Willie Mays]] and [[Babe Ruth]].  The Braves marked the first year of division play by winning the West.  The Braves were fifth place on [[August 19]], but outplayed the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] and [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]] down the stretch to win the division.  Aaron slugged 44 homers and knocked in 97 runs.  The Braves lost to the Miracle [[New York Mets|Mets]] in the playoffs, three games to none.  Aaron and brother [[Tommie Aaron|Tommie]] were the first siblings to appear in a League Championship series together as teammates.  Aaron finished 3rd in MVP voting.  Aaron got his 3,000th career hit off of [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]]' [[Wayne Simpson]] on [[May 17]], [[1970 in sports|1970]] with a single in the second game of a doubleheader at Cincinnati's Crosley Field, becoming the first player to reach that milestone and hit 500 career home runs.  On [[July 31]], he hit a home run against [[Dave Guisti]] of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]] in Atlanta for this 30th homer of the season, establishing a National League record for most seasons with 30 or more homers (12).  [[1971 in sports|1971]] saw several milestones for Aaron.  On [[April 27]] he hit his 600th career homer off the [[San Francisco Giants]]' [[Gaylord Perry]] in [[Atlanta]].

On the northern edge of the country (the Caspian coastal plain) the temperatures nearly fall below freezing and remain humid for the rest of the year. Summer temperatures rarely exceed 29Â°C (84Â°F). Annual precipitation is 680 mm (26 in) in the eastern part of the plain and more than 1700 mm (75 in) in the western side of the plain. To the west, settlements in the Zagros mountains basin experience lower temperatures. These areas have severe winters, with average daily temperatures below freezing and have heavy snowfall.

On [[June 16]], [[George W. Bush]] commented on this in vague language characterized by the press as &quot;hedging,&quot; &quot;noncommittal,&quot; and &quot;refusal to set a date,&quot; stating that the transfer would ''not'' take place until the U.S. was &quot;sure that he is secure.&quot; *On [[28 June]] [[2004]], the Coalition Provisional Authority dissolved and full governmental authority was transferred to the sovereign Iraqi Interim Government (IIG).  A few have asserted that the term &quot;return of sovereignty&quot; stems from a flawed understanding of international law: according to these individuals, sovereignty is vested in the people of Iraq, independently from the formal structure of the state. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1245135,00.html] But, this is misconstruing the intent of the phrase. The phrase usually means the return by one political agency to another political body of the exclusive rights to exercise supreme authority over a geographic region and group of people.  Regardless, Iraq was set on a direct path to full democratic elections in January &amp; December of 2005.  ===Interim period=== In [[November 2003]] the coalition announced plans to turn over sovereignty to an [[Iraq interim government|interim Iraqi government]] by mid-2004.  The actual transfer of sovereignty occurred on [[June 28]] [[2004]].  The interim president was [[Sheikh]] [[Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer]], and the interim prime minister [[Iyad Allawi]].  Under the [[Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period|interim Iraqi constitution]], signed March [[2004]], the country's executive branch is now led by a three-person presidential council. The election system for the council effectively ensures that all three of Iraq's major ethnic groups are represented. The constitution also includes basic freedoms like [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of speech|speech]], and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], and in many ways has been hailed as more liberal than the [[United States Constitution|U.S. constitution]].

Generated seq by model:- statistics are difficult to estimate. In the 2000 national census, an initial population estimate of 203 million was recorded: most of the population of [[Aceh]] was estimated from previous counts as the conflict meant that a survey was not possible, as were hard-to-reach regions of [[Papua]]. The Indonesian government later revised the estimate up to 206 million. Internationally, an undercount had been assumed, though there is no data to confirm it. The country's Central Statistics Bureau ([http://www.bps.go.id BPS]) and '''Statistics Indonesia''' quote 219.9 million as the population for 2005, while the [[CIA Factbook]] estimates are over 240 million.  Some parts of Indonesia are some of the most densly populated areas in the world: for example, [[Java (island)|Java]] is the most populous island in the world and many Indonesian cities are some of the most populous and densely populated.  Indonesia's population can be roughly divided into two groups. The west of the country is Asian and the people are mostly [[Malay people|Malay]], while the east is more Pacific and people on New Guinea are Papuan, with roots in the islands of [[Melanesia]]. There are, however, many more subdivisions,  since Indonesia spans an area the size of Europe or the USA and consists of many islands that to a large degree had separate developments. Many Indonesians identify with a more specific ethnic group that is often linked to language and regional origins; examples of these are [[Javanese]], [[Sundanese]], or [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]]. There are also quite different groups within many islands, such as [[Borneo]], with its [[Dayak]] and [[Punan]], who have different lifestyles and [[skintone]]s.  Most Indonesians speak a local language (''bahasa daerah'') as their first tongue, but the official national language, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] (locally called ''Bahasa Indonesia'') is almost universally taught in schools and is spoken by nearly every Indonesian.  It was originally a [[lingua franca]] for most of the region, including present-day [[Malaysia]] (and is thus closely related to [[Malay language|Malay]]),   accepted by the Dutch as the de facto language for the colony, and declared the official language after independence. The formerly large, influential [[Eurasian]] community (locally known as [[Indos]]) has largely left the country for the Netherlands, California and Australia, but some Eurasians remain in Indonesia and are highly esteemed models and soap opera stars.  Indonesia has serious ethnic tensions, particularly between [[Indonesian Chinese| Indonesians of Chinese ethnicity]] and the Pribumi peoples, who are considered natives of Indonesia. &quot;Non-Pribumi&quot; people are not always considered entirely Indonesian.  The [[Jakarta Riots of May 1998|riots in Jakarta in 1997 and 1998]] highlight this recurring tension.  Ethnic relations are strained mostly due to a perception that the Chinese community is too rich relative to the Pribumis, and that this is unfair.

Generated seq by model:- in ''B'' is created by the complex, but consistent transformation of ''A'' by our biological and mental makeup. Therefore, domain ''B'', or our reality, is internally logical. The scientific knowledge, or domain ''C'', is created by the application of a consistent [[methodology]] of analysis of our reality, ''B''. Therefore, the scientific domain is internally logical. Domains ''B'' and ''C'' each have their own internal logic, derived from a consistent approach respecting both [[process]]es and subject matter. Using the questions or processes of one domain on the subject matter of another domain will logically produce puzzles, [[paradox]]es, and inconsistencies. The Ship of Theseus problem is an example of such an inconsistency created by the use of the question of identity proper to the ontology of domain ''A'', applied to the subject matter of domain ''B'', our reality. The question about the identity of the Ship of Theseus is simply not receivable and comes from the poor practice of not respecting the proper correspondence of the question domain to the subject matter domain. The problem of identity is an ontological problem, and should therefore be applied to the (metaphysical) subject matter of domain ''A'', the real universe.  ==Update== * The sentence, &quot;S1 ''now'' has the property that it ''will'' have mast #2 contains in itself the assumption that S1 ''now'', and S1 ''later'', are the very same ship. It is a little like trying to prove [[theorem]] A using theorem A, is it not? * An example, very similar to the &quot;pilot&quot; example, but perhaps more realistic is: It is said that all the particles ([[atom]]s) that form a human body change during a period of seven years (although this is not actually so). This means that seven years ago, almost all our atoms were not the same as those of our current body. Does this mean that we are not the same (identical) person as we were, seven years ago? :Having observed this, an allowance for accumulated [[phenomenological]] [[experience]] attached to identity also defines that identity is independent of change. * Another example are the [[teleporter]]s in &quot;[[Star Trek]]&quot;, or in just about any other science fiction media for that matter, which either deconstruct and reconstruct the constituent molecules of the person being teleported, or replicate them in the exact order at the receiving end. In the first mechanism, even though the product is identical, the teleportee is still being destroyed, at least temporarily. In the second the eerie sense of separation is stronger. Not only is the teleportee completely destroyed, but nothing of him or her is actually transported, a copy simply being made.

In addition, Constantine instituted use of the [[labarum|Chi-Rho symbol]], representative of Christianity, also alleged by some scholars to have had use as an [[obelism|obeloi]] for &quot;auspicious&quot; thus serving both Christian and non-Christian purpose simultaneously.  Critics of the merger of church and state point to this [[constantinian shift|shift]] of the beginning of the era of Constantinianism when Christianity and the will of God gradually came to be identified with the will of the ruling elite; and in some cases was little more than a religious justification for the exercise of power.  Popular legend holds that Constantine I was Christian; however, he never publicly recanted his position as high priest of Mithras Sol Invictus, and the only alleged occurrence of Constantine I converting was on his deathbed (as reported by later Church Fathers), which is impossible to verify. However, it was not that unusual for people in the fourth century to avoid fully converting to Christianity until quite late in life, because of the strong warnings against continuing in sin after having converted and the spiritual consequences thereof.  Shocked by these developments, the emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] (denoted &quot;the [[Apostate]]&quot; because of his rejection of Christianity and conversion to [[Mithraism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]) attempted to restore the former status among religions by eliminating the privileges (exemption from the heavy burden of taxation and tax collection duties for [[Christian]] clergy for example) given by former Roman Emperors like [[Constantine I]], forbidding one sect of Christians from persecuting another [[Christian]] sect and recalling bishops who had been banned for [[Arianism]], while encouraging both Judaism (including a failed attempt to rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem) and a sort of [[neo-paganism]].  Julian's opposition was short lived, as emperors such as [[Constantine II of the Roman Empire|Constantine II]] repealed Julian's actions and encouraged the growth of Christianity. This state of affairs was finally enforced by a series of decrees by the Nicene Christian emperor [[Theodosius I]], beginning in February of 381, and continuing throughout his reign.  ==== Opposed by Byzantine emperors ==== * Saint [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] exiled from his bishopric in Alexandria at least five times for opposing Arianism. * Saint [[John Chrysostom]] ([[Patriarch of Constantinople]]) dies in exile for criticizing the imperial court in his homilies.  ==== Other material from this era ==== *[[Ambrose]] of Milan (bishop and saint) *rise of desert [[monasticism]] (Saint [[Anthony the Great]], Saint [[Pachomius]])  === Christological controversies === The [[Christological]] controversies include examinations of questions like the following.    *Was Christ divine, human, a created angelic being, or beyond simple classification into one category?   *Did Christ's miracles actually change physical reality or were they merely symbolic?   *Did Christ's body acth hibraiem[sctwopoacoctno ctpg

The mass exodus in the years following the famine must be seen in the context of overpopulation, industrial stagnation, land shortages, declining agricultural employment and inadequate diet. These factors were already combining to choke off population growth by the 1830s. It would be wrong, therefore, to attribute all the population loss during the famine, to the famine.  ==Memorials to the famine== The Great Famine is still remembered in many locations throughout Ireland, especially in those regions which suffered the greatest losses, and also in cities overseas with large populations descended from Irish immigrants. ===In Ireland=== * [[Strokestown]] Park Famine Museum, Ireland * [[Dublin City Quays]], Ireland. Painfully thin sculptural figures stand as if walking towards the emigration ships on the Dublin Quayside. * [[Murrisk]], [[County Mayo]], Ireland. This sculpture of a [[famine ship]], near the foot of [[Croagh Patrick]], depicts the refugees it carries as dead souls hanging from the sides. * [[Doolough]], County Mayo. A memorial commemorates famine victims who walked from [[Louisburgh]] along the mountain road to Delphi Lodge to seek relief from the Poor Board who were meeting there. Returning after their request was refused, many of them died at this point.   ===In the United Kingdom===  * [[Liverpool]], [[England]]. A memorial is in the grounds of St Luke's Church on Leece Street, itself a memorial to the victims of the Blitz. It recalls that from 1849-1852 1,241,410 Irish immigrants arrived in the city and that from Liverpool they dispersed to locations around the world. Many died though despite the help they recieved within the city, some 7000 in the city's parish within one year. The sculpture is dedicated to the memory of all famine emmigrants and their suffering. There is also a plaque on the gates to Clarence Dock. Unveiled in 2000 The plaque inscription reads in Gaelic and English: &quot;Through these gates passed most of the 1,300,000 Irish migrants who fled from the Great Famine and 'took the ship' to Liverpool in the years 1845-52&quot; The Maritime Museum, Albert Dock, Liverpool has an exhibition regarding the Irish Migration, showing models of ships, documentation and other facts on Liverpool's history. * [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]]. A magnificent Celtic Cross made of Irish Limestone on a base of Welsh stone stands in the city's Cathays Cemetary. The cross was unveiled in 1999 as the high point in the work of the Wales Famine Forum, remembering the 150th Anniversary of the famine. The memorial is dedicated to every person of Irish origin, without distinction on grounds of class, politics, allegiance or religious belief, who has died in Wales.  ===In North America=== * In [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], a bronze statue located at the corner of Washington and School Streets on the [[Freedom Trail]] depicts a starving woman, looking up to the heavens as if to ask &quot;Why?&quot;, wadla]G =o  r ofs=1 mw-3 R 5 n

See [[list of mathematicians]] for a list of biographies of mathematicians.''  The word &quot;[[mathematics]]&quot; comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &amp;#956;&amp;#940;&amp;#952;&amp;#951;&amp;#956;&amp;#945; (''mÃ¡thema'') which means &quot;science, knowledge, or learning&quot;; &amp;#956;&amp;#945;&amp;#952;&amp;#951;&amp;#956;&amp;#945;&amp;#964;&amp;#953;&amp;#954;&amp;#972;&amp;#962; (''mathematikÃ³s'') means &quot;fond of learning&quot;. Today, the term refers to a specific body of knowledge -- the rigorous, deductive study of quantity, structure, space and change.  While almost all cultures use basic mathematics{{rf|1|Amazon}} (counting and measuring), new mathematical discoveries have been reported in relatively few cultures and ages. Before the modern age and the worldwide spread of knowledge, written examples of new mathematical discoveries come to light only in a few locales. The most ancient mathematical texts come from [[ancient Egypt]] in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom period]] circa [[2000 BC|2000]]-[[1800 BC]] (Berlin 6619), [[Mesopotamia]] circa [[1900 BC|1900]]-[[1700 BC]] (Plympton 322), and [[ancient India]] circa [[800 BC|800]]-[[600 BC]] ([[Sulba Sutras]]). All of these texts concern the so-called [[Pythagorean theorem]], which seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical discovery after basic arithmetic and geometry. [[Ancient Greece]] and the [[Hellenistic]] cultures of [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the city of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] increased mathematical knowledge immensely. The [[Han Dynasty]] in [[ancient China]] circa [[200 BC]] to [[200|AD 200]] contributed the ''Sea Island Manual'' and ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]''. [[Jain]]a mathematicians contributed from [[200 BC]] to [[400|AD 400]], followed by [[Hindu]] mathematicians from [[400]] and [[Islam]]ic mathematicians from [[800]] who made major contributions to mathematics.  One striking feature about the history of ancient mathematics is that bursts of mathematical discovery tended to be followed by centuries of non-discovery. Beginning in [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]] in the [[16th century]], new mathematical discoveries, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an ever increasing pace, and this continues to the present day. People throughout the world have contributed to modern mathematics.  ==Mathematics in prehistory== Long before the earliest written records, there are drawings that indicate a knowledge of mathematics and of measurement of time based on the stars. For example, [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] have discovered [[ochre]] rocks in a cave in [[South Africa]] adorned with scratched [[Geometry|geometric]] patterns dating back to c. 70,000 BC [http://www.accessexcellerdiow] Aa b B |]  jt  Ec& Osf

The form was immensely popular in the 18th century. The looser type of couplet, with occasional enjambment, was one of the standard verse forms in medieval narrative poetry, largely because of the influence of the [[Canterbury Tales]].   English heroic couplets, especially in Dryden and his followers, are sometimes varied by the use of the occasional [[alexandrine]], or hexameter line, and triplet. Often these two variations are used together to heighten a climax. The breaking of the regular pattern of rhyming pentameter pairs brings about a sense of [[poetic closure]].  Here are three examples from Book IV of Dryden's translation of the ''[[Aeneid]]''.  ''Triplet'' :Nor let him then enjoy supreme command; :But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand,   :And lie unburied on the barren sand! :(ll. 890-892)  ''Alexandrine'' :Her lofty courser, in the court below, :Who his majestic rider seems to know,   :Proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground,   :And champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around. :(ll. 190-193)  ''Alexandrine and Triplet'' :My Tyrians, at their injurâd queenâs command,   :Had tossâd their fires amid the Trojan band;   :At once extinguishâd all the faithless name;   :And I myself, in vengeance of my shame, :Had fallân upon the pile, to mend the funâral flame. :(ll. 867-871)  [[Category:Poetic form]]</text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>Henry II of Saxony</title>     <id>14124</id>     <revision>       <id>15911701</id>       <timestamp>2004-06-11T16:41:33Z</timestamp>       <contributor>         <username>Timwi</username>         <id>13051</id>       </contributor>       <minor />       <comment>fix double-redirect</comment>       <text xml:space="preserve">#REDIRECT [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria]]</text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>Homosexuals</title>     <id>14126</id>     <revision>       <id>15911703</id>       <timestamp>2002-02-25T15:43:11Z</timestamp>       <contributor>         <ip>Conversion script</ip>       </contributor>       <minor />       <comment>Automated conversion</comment>       <text xml:space="preserve">#REDIRECT [[Homosexuality]] </text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>HÃ¶Ã°r</title>     <id>14127</id>     <revision>       <id>40699316</id>       <timestamp>2006-02-22T11:27:38Z</timestamp>       <contributor>         <username>Haukurth</username>         <id>16226</id>       </contributor>       <minor />       <comment>/* Gesta Danorum */ Modern names for geographical entitites that still exist</comment>       <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Loki and Hod.jpg|right|frame|[[Loki]] tricks HÃ¶Ã°r into shooting [[Baldr]].]]  '''HÃ¶Ã°r''' (often anglicized as '''Hod'''{{ref|name}}) is the blind brother of [[Baldr]] in [[Norse mythology]].

Originally, the group was restricted to humans and their [[extinct]] relatives, with the other great apes being placed in a separate family, the '''Pongidae'''. This definition is still used by many [[anthropologist]]s and by [[laity|lay people]]. However, that definition makes Pongidae [[paraphyletic]], whereas most taxonomists nowadays encourage [[monophyletic]] groups. Thus many [[biologist]]s consider Hominidae to include the Pongidae as the subfamily [[Ponginae]], or restrict the latter to the orangutan and extinct relatives like ''[[Gigantopithecus]]''. The taxonomy shown here follows the monophyletic groupings.  Especially close human relatives form a [[subfamily]], the [[Homininae]]. Some researchers go so far as to include chimpanzees and gorillas in the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' along with humans, but most genetic evidence suggests the relationships as shown here.

Morse is a senior [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] (Criminal Investigation Department) officer with the [[Thames Valley Police]] in [[Oxford]], England.  {{spoiler}}  ==Novels== It is primarily the personality of the main character that makes the Inspector Morse novels so successful. With his beautiful [[Jaguar_Mark_2|vintage Mark 2 Jaguar]] car (originally a [[Lancia]]), thirst for [[beer]], intellectual snobbery, and penchant for [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], he is a likeable person despite his sullen temperament. He also dislikes spelling errors and grammatical mistakes. This is demonstrated by the fact that in every personal or private document written to him, he manages to point out at least one spelling mistake.  Dexter is a fan of [[cryptic crossword]]s, and Inspector Morse is named after champion solver Sir [[Jeremy Morse]]. In every novel the surname of the killer is taken from those of winners of the weekly [[Azed]] solving competition that appears in ''[[The Observer]]''. Indeed, Dexter now writes a weekly &quot;how to solve cryptic crosswords&quot; column in the Observer's sister paper [[The Guardian]]. Morse's first name was kept a secret until the end of ''Death is Now My Neighbour'' (traditionally Morse claimed that he should be called 'Morse' or jokingly that his first name was 'Inspector'). The origin of his name is the vessel [[HM Bark Endeavour]], as Morse's father was a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] (Quakers have a tradition of &quot;virtue names&quot;) and a fan of [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]].

Generated seq by model:- al state. A contemporary of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]]s and other &quot;new monarchs&quot; in Western Europe, Ivan more than doubled his territories by placing most of north Russia under the rule of Moscow, and he proclaimed his absolute sovereignty over all Russian princes and nobles. Refusing further tribute to the Tartars, Ivan initiated a series of attacks that opened the way for the complete defeat of the declining Golden Horde, now divided into several khanates and hordes.  Ivan sought to protect the southern boundaries of his domain against attacks of [[Tatar invasions|hordes]]. Ivan granted manors to nobles, who in turn were obliged to serve in army. The manor system became a basis for an emerging horse army.  During his conflict with Pskov, monk [[Filofei]] composed a letter to Ivan III, with prophecy that the latter's kingdom will be the [[Third Rome]]. Ivan competed with his powerful northwestern rival Lithuania for control over some of the semi-independent former principalities of Kievan Rus' in the upper Dnieper and [[Donets River]] basins. Through the defections of some princes, border skirmishes, and a long, inconclusive war with Lithuania that ended only in [[1503]], Ivan III was able to push westward, and Muscovy tripled in size under his rule.  Internal consolidation accompanied outward expansion of the state. By the 16th century, the rulers of Moscow considered the entire Russian territory their collective property. Various semi-independent princes still claimed specific territories, but Ivan III forced the lesser princes to acknowledge the grand prince of Muscovy and his descendants as unquestioned rulers with control over military, judicial, and foreign affairs. Gradually, the Muscovite ruler emerged as a powerful, autocratic ruler, a tsar.  ===Ivan IV, the Terrible=== [[Image:Kremlinpic4.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|Portrait of Ivan the Terrible.]] Ivan IV was the first Muscovite ruler to use the title of &quot;[[Tsar]].&quot;  The development of the tsar's autocratic powers reached a peak during the reign ([[1547]]&amp;ndash;[[1584]]) of [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]], and he became known as &quot;Ivan the Terrible.&quot;  Ivan strengthened the position of the tsar to an unprecedented degree, as he ruthlessly subordinated the nobles to his will, exiling or executing many on the slightest provocation.  Nevertheless, Ivan was a farsighted statesman who promulgated a new code of laws, reformed the morals of the clergy, and built the great [[St. Basil's Cathedral]] that still stands in Moscow's [[Red Square]]. Also around this period, Russian cossacks were establishing the first settlements in western Siberia.  ===Time of Troubles=== Death of Ivan's childless son [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor]] was followed by a period of civil wars known as the &quot;[[Time of Troubles]]&quot; over the succession and resurgence of the power of the nobility.  The autocracy survived the &quot;Time of Troubles&quot; and the rule of weak or corrupt tsars because of the strength of the government's central bureaucracy. Gover &tg vslhae'b  m &  en'ioe&h

Generated seq by model:- citing hatred against any 'identifiable group' is an indictable offense under the [[Canadian Criminal Code]] with maximum terms of two to fourteen years. An 'identifiable group' is defined as 'any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, ethnic origin or sexual orientation.' It makes exceptions for cases of statements of truth, and subjects of public debate and religious doctrine.  * [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] has enacted the [[Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001]], which prohibits conduct that incites hatred against or serious contempt for, or involves revulsion or severe ridicule of another on the grounds of his race or religious beliefs.  ===Justification for laws controlling or prohibiting hate speech===  Proponents of limitations on hate speech argue that repeated instances of hate speech do more than express ideas or expresses dissent; rather, hate speech often promotes and results in fear, [[intimidation]] and harassment of individuals, and may result in [[murder]] and even [[genocide]] of those it is targeted against. As such, [[historical revisionism (political)|historical revisionism]] is thought to be a form of [[propaganda]] which, deleting [[memory]] of real events, allows them to repeat themselves (as in the: &quot;Never more!&quot;, following [[World War I]]... and then the [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust]]).   According to [[Critical race theory|Richard Delgado]], it is possible to identify hate speech on the use of certains key-words, arguing that &quot;Words such as '[[nigger]]' and '[[spick]]' are badges of degradation even when used between friends: ''these words have no other connotation''.&quot; Therefore, the act of calling someone a name should be censored if the name used belongs to a previously-identified hate speech. However, [[Judith Butler]] (1997) claims that &quot;this very statement, whether written in his text or cited here, has another connotation; he has just used the word in a significantly different way.&quot; (Butler considers that &quot;mentioning&quot; a word is an effective &quot;use&quot; of the word in another context) {{ref|Butler}} On this basis, Butler claims that words do not have an absolute meaning, but one that depends on the context. She thus underlines the difficulty of identifying a hate-speech. Ultimately, the state itself defines the limits of acceptable [[discourse]], according to her. However, Butler takes the precaution to explicitly deny being against all forms of limitation of discourse, the object of her book being only to point out the different issues at stake when one address the problem of hate speech and censorship. She points out, for example, that the very act of forbidding hate-speech reconducts this hate-speech, as quoted by juridical authorities, thus leading to a proliferation of this discourse - Butler's reasoning here follows [[Michel Foucault]]'s statement according to which sexuality has not only been censored during the [[Victorian era]]: it was also put in discourse through a &quot;sexuality dispa ot l  &bt dahse wo es  niorc

Its origins are not entirely clear, but it is believed to have been used first in the financing of long-distance trade in the early [[medieval]] period on [[trading route]]s such as the [[Silk Road]], the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. Hawala is mentioned in texts of [[Islamic jurisprudence]] as early as the [[8th century]]. In [[South Asia]], it appears to have developed into a fully-fledged [[money market instrument]], which was only gradually replaced by the instruments of the formal [[banking system]] in the first half of the [[20th century]]. Today hawala is probably used mostly for [[migrant worker]]s' remittances to their countries of origin.  In the most basic variant of the hawala system, money is transferred via a network of hawala brokers, or hawaladars. A customer approaches a hawala broker in one city and gives a sum of money to be transferred to a recipient in another, usually foreign, city. The hawala broker calls another hawala broker in the recipient's city, gives disposition instructions of the funds (usually minus a small commission), and promises to settle the [[debt]] at a later date.  The unique feature of the system is that no [[Promissory_note|promissory instrument]]s are exchanged between the hawala brokers; the transaction takes place entirely on the [[honor system]]. As the system does not depend on the legal enforceability of claims, it can operate even in a defunct legal and juridical environment. No records are produced of individual transactions; only a running tally of the amount owed one broker by the other is kept. Settlements of debts between hawala brokers can take a variety of forms, and need not take the form of direct cash transactions.   In addition to commissions, hawala brokers often earn their profits through bypassing official [[exchange rate]]s. Generally the funds enter the system in the source country's [[currency]] and leave the system in the recipient country's currency. As settlements often take place without any foreign exchange transactions, they can be made at ([[black market|black]]) market rates rather than official rates.   Hawala is attractive to customers because it provides a fast, convenient and safe transfer of funds, usually with a far lower commission than that charged by banks. Its advantages are most pronounced when the receiving country applies distortive exchange rate regulations (as has been the case for many typical receiving countries such as [[Pakistan]] or [[Egypt]]) or when the bankint     a         o  nlm    ds o

Generated seq by model:- H = \frac{IB}{ned}  &lt;/math&gt;  where ''V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the voltage across the width of the plate, ''I'' is the current across the plate length, ''B'' is the magnetic field, ''d'' is the depth of the plate, ''e'' is the electron charge, and ''n'' is the [[bulk density]] of the carrier electrons.  So-called &quot;[[Hall effect sensor]]s&quot; are readily available from a number of different manufacturers, and may be used in various sensors such as fluid [[flow sensor]]s, [[power sensor]]s, and [[pressure sensor]]s.  In the presence of large [[magnetic field]] strength and low [[temperature]], one can observe the [[quantum Hall effect]], which is the [[quantum mechanics|quantization]] of the Hall resistance.  In [[ferromagnetic]] materials (and [[paramagnetic]] materials in a [[magnetic field]]), the Hall resistivity includes an additional contribution, known as the '''Anomalous Hall Effect''' (or the '''Extraordinary Hall effect'''), which depends directly on the [[magnetization]] of the material, and is often much larger than the ordinary Hall effect. (Note that this effect is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; due to the contribution of the [[magnetization]] to the total [[magnetic field]].) Although a well-recognized phenomenon, there is still debate about its origins in the various materials. The anomalous Hall effect can be either an &lt;i&gt;extrinsic&lt;/i&gt; (disorder-related) effect due to [[spin (physics)|spin]]-dependent [[scattering]] of the [[charge carrier]]s, or an &lt;i&gt;intrinsic&lt;/i&gt; effect which can be described in terms of the [[Berry phase]] effect in the crystal momentum space (&lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt;-space).  ==Applications==  Hall effect devices produce a very low signal level and thus require amplification. While suitable for laboratory instruments, the [[vacuum tube]] [[amplifier]]s available in the first half of the [[20th century]] were too expensive, power consuming, and unreliable for everyday applications. It was only with the development of the low cost [[integrated circuit]] that the Hall effect sensor became suitable for mass application. Many devices now sold as &quot;[[Hall effect sensor]]s&quot; are in fact a device containing both the sensor described above and a high gain [[integrated circuit]] (IC) amplifier in a single package. Reed switch electrical motors using the hall effect IC is another application.  ===Advantages over other methods=== Hall effect devices when appropriately packaged are immune to dust, dirt, mud, and water. These characteristics make Hall effect devices better for position sensing than alternative means such as optical and electromechanical sensing.

Generated seq by model:- three caliphs. They honor different traditions ([[hadith]]) and have their own legal traditions. Shi'a scholars have a larger authority than Sunni scholars and have greater room for interpretation. The [[Imams]] play a central role in Shi'a doctrine. Shi'a Muslims hold that Muhammad, his daughter Fatima and the twelve descendants of Muhammad, the [[Imams]], were all sinless and pure.  The arabic word Shi'a, litarally translates into the word 'group' or 'sect'. Originally known as Shi'at Ali (the sect of Ali), the group formed shortly after the death of Ali, in [[Iraq]]. Ali ibn Abi Talib was the cousin of prophet [[Muhammad]], and after marriage to Fatima, he also became Muhammad's son-in-law.  The Shi'a consist of one major school of thought known as the [[Ithna 'ashariyah]] or the &quot;[[Twelvers]]&quot;, and a few minor schools of thought, as the &quot;Seveners&quot; or the &quot;Fivers&quot; referring to the number of infallible leaders they recognize after the death of prophet [[Muhammad]]. The term Shi'a, when used without qualification, is usually taken to be synonymous with the Ithna Ashariyya or Twelvers. Most Shi'a live in [[Iran]], [[Iraq]] (the country where Ali passed away), [[Bahrain]], [[Lebanon]], [[India]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Yemen]] and [[Pakistan]]. A minority group (about 4 million) of Shi'a is known as [[Ismaili]]. The Shia Ismaili branch is subdivided into [[Nizari]] Ismaili and [[Mustaali]] Bohra subsects. The Nizari Ismaili or are led by the [[Aga Khan]] and are found mainly in [[Pakistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Bangladesh]], India, Canada and United States. The [[Mustaali]] Bohra sect is further subdivded into Dawoodi and Sulaimanis subsects. The [[Dawoodi Bohra]]s are concentrated in Pakistan and India. The [[Sulaimani Bohra]]s are concentrated in Yemen and Najran province of Saudi Arabia.  {{see also|Historic background of the Sunni-Shi'a split}}  ===Sufism=== [[Sufism]] is a spiritual practice followed by both Sunni and Shi'a. Sufis generally feel that following Islamic law or jurisprudence (or ''fiqh'') is only the first step on the path to perfect submission; they focus on the internal or more spiritual aspects of Islam, such as perfecting one's faith and fighting one's own ego (''nafs''). Most Sufi orders, or [[tariqa]], can be classified as either Sunni or Shi'a. However, there are some that are not easily categorized as either Sunni or Shi'a, such as the [[Bektashi]]. Sufis are found throughout the Islamic world, from [[Senegal]] to [[Indonesia]].  ===Others=== [[Wahhabi]]s, as they are known by non-Wahhabis, are a smaller, more recent Sunni group. They prefer to be called [[Salafi]]s. Wahhabism is a movement founded by [[Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab]] in the [[18th century]] in what is present-day [[Saudi Arabia]]. They classify themselves as Sunni and some claim to follow the [[Hanbali]] legal tradition. The major trend, however, is the  abolition of these &quot;schools of thoughts&quot; (legal traditions), and the following of a more literalist interpretation.

He was born at [[Duffryn]], [[Aberdare]], [[Glamorganshire]], the son of John Bruce, a Glamorganshire landowner. John Bruce's original family name was Knight, but on coming of age in [[1805]] he assumed the name of Bruce: his mother, through whom he inherited the Duffryn estate, was the daughter of William Bruce, high sheriff of Glamorganshire. Henry was educated at [[Swansea Grammar School]], and in [[1837]] was called to the [[barrister|bar]].  Shortly after he had begun to practise, the discovery of [[coal]] beneath the Duffryn and other Aberdare Valley [[estate (house)|estates]] brought the family great wealth.

Generated seq by model:- uning]] for alterations specific to wire-stringed instruments and certain electric pianos.) However, those alterations are small, and except for precise, highly specialized tuning, it is reasonable to think of the frequencies of the harmonic series as integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.  The harmonic series is an [[arithmetic series]] (2Ãf, 3Ãf, 4Ãf, 5Ãf, ...). In terms of frequency (measured in cycles per second, or [[hertz]] (Hz)), the difference between consecutive harmonics is therefore constant. But because our ears respond to sound [[logarithm|logarithmically]], we perceive higher harmonics as &quot;closer together&quot; than lower ones. On the other hand, the [[octave]] series is a [[geometric progression]] (2Ãf, 4Ãf, 8Ãf, 16Ãf, ...), and we hear these distances as &quot;the same&quot; in all ranges. In terms of what we hear, each octave in the harmonic series is divided into increasingly &quot;smaller&quot; and more numerous intervals.  The second harmonic, twice the frequency of the fundamental, sounds an [[octave]] higher; the third harmonic, three times the frequency of the fundamental, sounds a [[perfect fifth]] above the second. The fourth harmonic vibrates at four times the frequency of the fundamental and sounds a [[perfect fourth]] above the third (two octaves above the fundamental). Double the harmonic number means double the frequency (which sounds an octave higher). The combined oscillation of a string with several of its lowest harmonics can be seen clearly in an interactive animation at [http://id.mind.net/~zona/mstm/physics/waves/standingWaves/standingWaves1/StandingWaves1.html Edward Zobel's &quot;Zona Land&quot;].  [[Image:Hseries.png|frame|right|An illustration of the harmonic series as musical notation. Not all the notes are exactly in tune; see below for details.]] For a fundamental of C1, the first 16 harmonics are notated as shown. You can listen to [[media:Harmonics 110x16.ogg|A2 (110 Hz) and 15 of its partials]] if you have [[Wikipedia:Media help|a media player capable]] of playing [[Vorbis]] files. You can also hear a sweep of the first 20 harmonics of A1 (55 Hz) in Quicktime format by [http://www.music.sc.edu/fs/bain/atmi02/hs/playback/sweep/ clicking here].  == Terminology ==  '''''Harmonic vs. partial.''''' Harmonics are often called partials. In some contexts, &quot;partial&quot; may refer to an [[overtone]] that is ''not'' an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency, but this can be confusing in wire-stringed instruments where, due to [[inharmonicity]], ''none'' of the harmonics vibrate at ''exact'' integer multiples of the fundamental. In music, and especially among tuning professionals, the words &quot;harmonic&quot; and &quot;partial&quot; are generally interchangeable.  Likewise, many musicians use the term '''''overtones''''' as a synonym for harmonics. For others, an [[overtone]] may be any frequency that sounds along with the fundamental tone, regardless of its relationship to the [[fundamental frequency]].

Generated seq by model:- s. [http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0000079]. A lengthier article on the system of human iron regulation can be found in the article on [[human iron metabolism]].  === Dietary sources === Good sources of dietary iron include [[meat]], [[fish]], [[poultry]], [[lentil]]s, [[bean]]s, [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[tofu]], [[chickpea]]s, [[black-eyed pea]], [[strawberry|strawberries]] and [[farina (food)|farina]].  Iron provided by [[dietary supplement]]s is often found as [[Ferrous fumarate|Iron (II) fumarate]]. The [[Recommended Dietary Allowance|RDA]] for iron varies considerably based on the age, gender, and source of dietary iron ([[heme]]-based iron has higher [[bioavailability]])[http://www.iom.edu/Object.File/Master/7/294/0.pdf]. Also note the section below on [[#Precautions|precautions]].  Metallic iron filings are added to some [[breakfast cereals]] and listed in the ingredients as &quot;reduced iron&quot; (&quot;reduced&quot; referring to [[redox]] chemistry). If the cereal is crushed, the iron filings can be separated with a magnet.  == Precautions == Excessive iron is toxic to humans, because excess ferrous iron reacts with [[peroxide]]s in the body, producing [[free radical]]s. Iron becomes toxic when it exceeds the amount of [[transferrin]] needed to bind free iron. In excess, uncontrollable quantities of free radicals are produced.   [[human iron metabolism|Iron uptake is tightly regulated]] by the human body, which has no physiologic means of excreting iron and regulates iron solely by regulating uptake. However, too much ingested iron can damage the cells of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] directly, and may enter the bloodstream by damaging the cells that would otherwise regulate its entry. Once there, it causes damage to cells in the [[heart]], [[liver]] and elsewhere. This can cause serious problems, including the potential of death from overdose, and long-term organ damage in survivors.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every kilogram of weight, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a lethal dose.[http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic285.htm] Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantitities of [[ferrous sulfate]] tablets intended for adult consumption, is the most common toxicological cause of death in children under six. The [[Dietary Reference Intake|DRI]] lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45 [[milligram|mg]]/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.  If iron intake is excessive [[iron overload disorder]]s can sometimes result, such as [[hemochromatosis]]. Iron overload disorders require a genetic inability to regulate iron uptake; however, many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it and without knowing a family history of the problem. For this reason, people should not take iron supplements unless they suffer from [[iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]] and have consulted a doctor.

Later in the year, it moved onto to the [[World Wide Web]] (a network in its infancy back then) under the name of ''Cardiff Internet Movie Database''. The database resided on the [[servers]] of the computer science department of [[Cardiff University]] in [[Wales]]. [[Rob Hartill]] was the original web interface author. In [[1994 in film|1994]], the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information, meaning that people no longer had to email the specific list maintainer with their updates. However, the structure remained that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers, the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein.  Its management also continued to be in the hands of a small contingent of underpaid or volunteer &quot;section managers&quot; who were receiving ever-growing quantities of information on films from around the world and across time from contributors of widely varying level of expertise and informational resources.  Despite the annual claims of Needham, in a year-end report newsletter to the Top 50 contributors, that &quot;fewer holes&quot; must now remain for the coming year, the amount of information still missing from the database was vastly underestimated.  Over the next few years, the database was run on a network of [[mirror (computing)|mirrors]] across the world with donated bandwidth.  ===As an independent company===  In [[1995]], it became obvious to the principal site managers that the project had become too large to maintain merely through donations and in their spare time. The decision was made to become a commercial venture and in [[1996]], IMDb was incorporated in the [[United Kingdom]], becoming the Internet Movie Database Ltd, with [[Col Needham]] the primary owner as well as identifed figurehead. The remaining shareholders were the people maintaining the database. Revenue was generated through advertising, licensing and partnerships.  This state of affairs continued until [[1998]]. The database was growing every day, and it was again reaching a critical point.  Most revenues were being spent on equipment, and shareholders were finding it difficult to reconcile the fact that for all their hard work they themselves were getting very little income. Many, by this time, had families to support and interact with, and could not hold regular paying jobs and meet the increasing needs of the database.  The company's ability to add and upgrade equipment was dwindling, while the number of new informational submissions, as well as fan text, were increasing incrementally.  The system was suffering noticeable slowdowns both in accessing the sitee    a  c oe<   er   m  u f

Generated seq by model:- a'' by ''b''. This is the basis for the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for computing [[greatest common divisor]]s.  Again, in the language of abstract algebra, the above says that '''Z''' is a [[Euclidean domain]]. This implies that '''Z''' is a [[principal ideal domain]] and any positive integer can be written as the products of [[prime number|primes]] in an essentially unique way.  This is the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]].  ==Order-theoretic properties ==  '''Z''' is a [[total order|totally ordered set]] without upper or lower bound.  The ordering of '''Z''' is given by : ... &lt; &amp;minus;2 &lt; &amp;minus;1 &lt; 0 &lt; 1 &lt; 2 &lt; ... An integer is ''positive'' if it is greater than zero and ''negative'' if it is less than zero.  Zero is defined as neither negative nor positive.   The ordering of integers is compatible with the algebraic operations in the following way: # if ''a'' &lt; ''b'' and ''c'' &lt; ''d'', then ''a'' + ''c'' &lt; ''b'' + ''d'' # if ''a'' &lt; ''b'' and 0 &lt; ''c'', then ''ac'' &lt; ''bc''.  (From this fact, one can show that if ''c'' &lt; 0, then ''ac'' &gt; ''bc''.)  ==Integers in computing== {{Main|Integer (computer science)}}  An integer (sometimes known as an &quot;&lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;, from the name of a datatype in the [[C programming language]]) is often a primitive [[datatype]] in [[computer language]]s.  However, integer datatypes can only represent a [[subset]] of all integers, since practical computers are of finite capacity.  Variable-length representations of integers, such as [[bignum]]s, can store any integer that fits in the computers memory.  Other integer datatypes are implemented with a fixed size, usually a number of bits which is a power of 2 (4, 8, 16, ''etc.'') or a memorable number of decimal digits (''e.g.'', 9 or 10).    In contrast, theoretical models of [[digital computer]]s, such as [[Turing machine]]s, typically do have infinite (but only [[countable]]) capacity.  ==Quotation==  ''God invented the integers, all else is the work of man.''

Generated seq by model:- ), [[Germany]]. It is also the capital of the surrounding [[Hanover (district)|Hanover district]] and was the capital of the  [[Hanover (region)|Hanover region]] until Lower Saxony's regions were disbanded at the beginning of 2005.  ==History== The town was founded in medieval times on the bank of the river Leine (the original name ''Honovere'' may be translated as &quot;high bank&quot;). It was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen, which became a comparatively large town in the [[13th century]]. In the [[14th century]] the main [[church]]es of Hanover were built, as well as a [[city wall]] with three [[town gates]] to secure the city.  In [[1636]] the Duke of [[Calenberg]] decided to move his residence to Hanover. His [[duchy]] was afterwards known as the Duchy of Hanover (see: [[House of Hanover]]). His descendants would later become kings of the [[United Kingdom]]; the first of them was [[George I of the United Kingdom|George I]], who ascended to the British throne in [[1714]]. Three kings of the United Kingdom were at the same time [[prince-elector|Electoral Princes]] of Hanover.  During the [[Seven Years' War]] on [[July 26]], [[1757]] the [[Battle of Hastenbeck]] took place. The [[France|French]] army defeated the [[Hanoverian Army of Observation]], leading to the occupation of Hanover.  [[Image:New town hall Hannover.jpg|thumb|left|New Town Hall in Hanover]]  After [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] imposed the [[Convention of Artlenburg]] (Convention of the Elbe) on [[July 5]], [[1803]] about 30,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The convention also meant the disbanding of the army of Hanover. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe and made an effort to recruit foreign troops. As a result a great number of soldiers of Hanover eventually emigrated to [[England]] leading to the [[King's German Legion]] which later played an important role in the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. At the [[Congress of Vienna]] in [[1814]] [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] elevated the electorate to the [[Hanover (state)|Kingdom of Hanover]]. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and grew considerably.  In [[1837]] the [[personal union]] of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended as [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV's]] [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|heir in the United Kingdom]] was female, and Hanover could be [[Salic Law|inherited only by males]]. Hanover continued as a kingdom until [[1866]], when it was annexed by [[Prussia]]. After the annexation, the people of Hanover opposed the Prussian regime. Nevertheless, the growth of Hanover continued until [[World War II]], when two thirds of the town was bombed to ruins. After the war, Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany, and later became famous for hosting commercial expositions such as the [[CeBIT]] and the [[Hanover Fair]]. In [[2000]], Hanover hosted the [[Expo 2000]].  ==Sights== [[Image:Kroepke 1895.jpg|thumb|KrÃ¶pke, 1895]] [[Image:Hannover - Hauptbahni 2fbm [[[wh{CI {lS[ f2*P[<Jow

These perspectives opposed or de-emphasized the importance of the [[rationality]] of human beings. Instead, they concentrated on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s &quot;[[noumenon|noumenal realm]]&quot;, or the experience of one's own existence.   Part of the movements involved claims that [[science]] was inferior to [[intuition]].  In this project, [[art]] was given an especially high place, as it was considered the gateway to the noumenon. Unfortunately, not all of the public at the time were involved in this movement and only the [[elite]] had access to the [[art]] (ie. a &quot;Mandarin elitism&quot;).  Some of the followers of this idea are [[Nietzsche]], [[Dostoevsky]], [[Bergson]], and [[Sorel]]. [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[existentialism]] grew out of these schools of thought.  ==See also== *[[Rationalism]]  {{philo-stub}} [[Category:Ethics]]  [[sk:Iracionalizmus]]</text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>Indonesia</title>     <id>14579</id>     <revision>       <id>42108852</id>       <timestamp>2006-03-03T21:59:05Z</timestamp>       <contributor>         <username>Klaam</username>         <id>840384</id>       </contributor>       <text xml:space="preserve">{{Infobox_Country| native_name = Republik Indonesia | common_name = Indonesia | image_flag = Flag_of_Indonesia.svg | image_coat = Coat_of_Indonesia.png | image_map = LocationIndonesia.png | national_motto = [[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]&lt;br&gt;([[Javanese language#Old Javanese|Old Javanese]]/[[Kawi language|Kawi]]: Unity in Diversity)&lt;br&gt; [[ideology|National ideology]]: [[Pancasila Indonesia | Pancasila]]| national_anthem = [[Indonesia Raya]] | official_languages = [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] (Bahasa Indonesia, a [[standard language|standardized dialect]] of the [[Malay language]]) | capital = [[Jakarta]] |latd=6|latm=08|latNS=S|longd=106|longm=45|longEW=E| largest_city = [[Jakarta]] | government_type = [[Republic]] | leader_titles = [[List of Presidents of Indonesia|President]] | leader_names = [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] | area_rank = 15th | area_magnitude = 1_E10 | area=1,919,440 | percent_water = 4.85% | population_estimate = 241,973,879 | population_estimate_year = 2005 | population_estimate_rank = 4th | population_census=206,264,595| population_census_year=2000| popula /n <crm0|2A riA{i oo* efhoe|2

Generated seq by model:-  than zero and ''negative'' if it is less than zero.  Zero is defined as neither negative nor positive.   The ordering of integers is compatible with the algebraic operations in the following way: # if ''a'' &lt; ''b'' and ''c'' &lt; ''d'', then ''a'' + ''c'' &lt; ''b'' + ''d'' # if ''a'' &lt; ''b'' and 0 &lt; ''c'', then ''ac'' &lt; ''bc''.  (From this fact, one can show that if ''c'' &lt; 0, then ''ac'' &gt; ''bc''.)  ==Integers in computing== {{Main|Integer (computer science)}}  An integer (sometimes known as an &quot;&lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;, from the name of a datatype in the [[C programming language]]) is often a primitive [[datatype]] in [[computer language]]s.  However, integer datatypes can only represent a [[subset]] of all integers, since practical computers are of finite capacity.  Variable-length representations of integers, such as [[bignum]]s, can store any integer that fits in the computers memory.  Other integer datatypes are implemented with a fixed size, usually a number of bits which is a power of 2 (4, 8, 16, ''etc.'') or a memorable number of decimal digits (''e.g.'', 9 or 10).    In contrast, theoretical models of [[digital computer]]s, such as [[Turing machine]]s, typically do have infinite (but only [[countable]]) capacity.  ==Quotation==  ''God invented the integers, all else is the work of man.''

Generated seq by model:- though the Soviet Union was victorious in World War II, its economy had been devastated in the struggle and the war resulted in around 27 million Soviet deaths. About seventy thousand settlements have been destroyed. Ten million Soviet citizens became victims of a repressive policy of Germans and their allies on an occupied territory. German ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', along with Baltic and Ukrainian collaborators, were engaged in genocide of the Soviet Jewish population. The Romanian armies took part in genocide of Jews in occupied Odessa area. During occupation, Russia's Leningrad region lost around a quarter of its population. The occupied territories suffered from the ravages of German occupation, deportations of slave labour, as well as the Soviets' own scorched earth tactics in the retreat. Perhaps millions of Soviet citizens on occupied territories died because of famine and absence of elementary medical aid. Perhaps around 3.5 million Soviet prisoners of war (of 5.5 million) died in German camps.  ====Cold War==== ''Main article: [[Cold War]]''  Collaboration among the major Allies had won the war and was supposed to serve as the basis for postwar reconstruction and security. However, the conflict between Soviet and U.S. national interests, known as the [[Cold War]], came to dominate the international stage in the postwar period, assuming the public guise as a clash of ideologies.  The Cold War emerged out of a conflict between Stalin and U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] over the future of Eastern Europe during the [[Potsdam Conference]] in the summer of 1945. Russia had suffered three devastating Western onslaughts in the previous 150 years during the Napoleonic Wars, the First World War, and the Second World War, and Stalin's goal was to establish a buffer zone of states between Germany and the Soviet Union. Truman charged that Stalin had betrayed the [[Yalta]] agreement. With Eastern Europe under Red Army occupation, Stalin was also biding his time, as his own [[Soviet atomic bomb project|atomic bomb project]] was steadily and secretly progressing.  In April [[1949]] the United States sponsored the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), a mutual defense pact in which most Western nations pledged to treat an armed attack against one nation as an assault on all. The Soviet Union established an Eastern counterpart to NATO in [[1955]], dubbed the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The division of Europe into Western and Soviet blocs later took on a more global character, especially after [[1949]], when the U.S. nuclear monopoly ended with the testing of [[Joe-1|a Soviet bomb]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] takeover in [[People's Republic of China|China]].  The foremost objectives of Soviet foreign policy were the maintenance and enhancement of national security and the maintenance of hegemony over Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union maintained its dominance over the Warsaw Pact through crushing the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], suppressing the [[Prague Spring]] in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and supporting the supl   t; T&[     r    I  == c

Exclusive trade routes often came at a high price. In most foreign cities, the Hanse traders were confined to certain trading areas and to their own trading posts. They were seldom, if ever, allowed to interact with the local inhabitants, except in the matter of actual negotiation. Moreover, the power of the League was envied by many, merchant and noble alike. For example, in London there was continuing pressure from the local merchants for the Hanseatic League's privileges to be revoked. This tension was exacerbated by the refusal of the League to offer reciprocal arrangements to their English counterparts. The league's privileges were reconfirmed by [[King Edward IV]] in [[1474]] despite this hostility. This was at least in part thanks to the significant financial contribution the League made during [[The Wars of the Roses]]. A century later, in [[1597]], [[Queen Elizabeth I]] expelled the League from London and the [[Steelyard]] was closed in [[1598]]. The very existence of the League and its privileges and monopolies created economic and social tensions that often crept over into rivalry between League members.  ===Downfall=== The Hansa was not spared the economic crises of the late [[14th century]], but its eventual rivals were the [[Nation state|territorial states]], whether new or revived, and not just in the west: [[Poland]] triumphed over the [[Teutonic Knights]] in [[1466]]; [[Ivan III of Russia]] ended the entrepreneurial independence of Novgorod in [[1478]]. New vehicles of credit imported from [[Italy]] outpaced the Hansa economy, where silver coin changed hands rather than bills of exchange.  At the start of the 16th century, the League was in a weaker position than it had known for many years. The Baltic monopoly was being actively challenged by Dutch and English merchants. The rising [[Swedish Empire]] had taken possession of much of the Baltic. Denmark had regained control over its own trade, the Kontor in Novgorod had shut and the Kontor in Brugge was effectively defunct. The individual cities which made up the League had also started to put self interest before common good. Finally the political authority of the German princes was starting to grow and so constrain the indepence of action which the merchants and Hanseatic Towns had enjoyed.  The League attempted to deal with some of these issues. The League created the post of Syndic in [[1556]] and elected a permanent official with legal training, who worked to protect and extend the diplomatic agreements of the member towns. In [[1557]] and [[1579]] revised agreements were made spelling out the duties of towns and progress was made. The Brugge Kontor was moved to Antwerp and new routes attempted. However the League was unable to halt the progress around it and so started its long decline. The Antwerp Kontor was shut in [[1593]], the London Kontor in [[1598]].

[[George Gamow]], [[Ralph Alpher]], and [[Robert Hermann]] had calculated that there should be evidence for a Big Bang in the background temperature of the universe{{fn|1}}. In 1964, [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Wilson]]{{fn|2}} discovered a 3 kelvin background hiss in their [[Bell Labs]] [[radiotelescope]], which was evidence for this hypothesis, and formed the basis for a number of results that helped determine the [[age of the universe]].  Supernova [[SN1987A]] was observed by astronomers on Earth both visually, and in a triumph for [[neutrino astronomy]], by the solar neutrino detectors at [[Kamiokande]]. But the solar neutrino flux was [[solar neutrino problem|a fraction of its theoretically-expected value]]. This discrepancy forced a change in some values in the [[standard model]] for [[particle physics]].  ====Biology, medicine, and genetics==== {{main articles|[[History of biology]], [[History of medicine]] and [[History of evolutionary thought]]}} [[Image:dna-split.png|thumb|left|140px|Semi-conservative [[DNA]] replication.]]  In 1847, Hungarian physician [[Ignaz Semmelweis|IgnÃ¡c FÃ¼lÃ¶p Semmelweis]] dramatically reduced the occurrency of [[puerperal fever]] by the simple experiment of requiring physicians to wash their hands before attending to women in childbirth. This discovery predated the [[germ theory of disease]]. However, Semmelweis' findings were not appreciated by his contemporaries and came into use only with discoveries by British surgeon [[Joseph Lister]], who in 1865 proved the principles of [[antisepsis]]. Lister's work was based on the important findings by French biologist [[Louis Pasteur]]. Pasteur was able to link microorganisms with disease, revolutionizing medicine. He also devised one of the most important methods in [[preventive medicine]], when in 1880 he produced a [[vaccine]] against [[rabies]]. Pasteur invented the process of [[pasteurization]], to help prevent the spread of disease through milk and other foods.  Perhaps the most prominent and far-reaching theory in all of science has been the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] put forward by the British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] in his ''On [[the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859. Darwin's theory proposed that all differences in animals were formed by natural processes over long periods of time, and that even [[human]]s were simply evolved organisms.

For one thing I got the idea all at once and didn't have to fiddle with it; and I wrote it in white-heat and scarcely had to change a word. This sort of things endears any story to any writer.  :Then, too, it has had the strangest effect on my readers. Frequently someone writes to ask me if I can give them the name of a story, which they ''think'' I may have written, and tell them where to find it. They don't remember the title but when they describe the story it is invariably &quot;The Last Question&quot;. This has reached the point where I recently received a long-distance phone call from a desperate man who began, &quot;Dr. Asimov, there's a story I think you wrote, whose title I can't remember&amp;mdash;&quot; at which point I interrupted to tell him it was &quot;The Last Question&quot; and when I described the plot it proved to be indeed the story he was after. I left him convinced I could read minds at a distance of a thousand miles.  Beginning in 1977, he lent his name to ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' (now ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'') and penned an editorial for each issue.  There was also a short-lived ''Asimov's SF Adventure Magazine'' and a companion ''Asimov's Science Fiction Anthology'' reprint series, published as magazines (in the same manner as stablemates ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine]]'''s &quot;anthologies&quot;).  ===Popular science=== During the late 1950s and 1960s, Asimov shifted gears somewhat, and substantially decreased his fiction output (he published only four adult novels between 1957's ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' and 1982's ''Foundation's Edge'', two of which were mysteries). At the same time, he greatly increased his non-fiction production, writing mostly on science topics; the launch of [[Sputnik]] in 1957 engendered public concern over a &quot;science gap&quot;, which Asimov's publishers were eager to fill with as much material as he could write. Meanwhile, the monthly ''[[Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'' invited him to continue his regular non-fiction column, begun in the now-folded bimonthly companion magazine ''[[Venture Science Fiction]]'', ostensibly dedicated to [[popular science]], but with Asimov having complete editorial freedom. The first of the ''F&amp;SF'' columns appeared in November of 1958, and they followed uninterrupted thereafter, with 399 entries, until Asimov's terminal illness took its toll.  These columns, periodically collected into books by his principal publisher, [[Doubleday]], helped make Asimov's reputation as a &quot;Great Explainer&quot; of science and were referred to by him as his only pop-science writing in which he never had to assume complete ignorance of the subjects at hand on the part of his readers.  The popularity of his first wide-ranging reference work, ''The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science'', also allowed him to give up most of his academic responsibilities and become essentially a ff  o <   <*Acx |eo   i e Fo 1a

Generated seq by model:-  to re-colonize the country, the Indonesian Nationalists won recognition for the newly formed Republic of Indonesia. In doing so, it became among the first [[Third World]] nations to gain its independence.  After gaining independence, the Republic of Indonesia has largely been ruled from a strong central government in [[Jakarta]]. After Indonesia's founding President Sukarno was weakened by prolonged warfare with [[Malaysia]] and its allies in the ''[[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|Konfrontasi]]'', and by internal conflict between the Indonesian Army and the Communist Party of Indonesia, the general [[Suharto]] took power in [[1966]]. The period of his rule, known as the era of the New Order, would last 32 years and would make Indonesia a rapidly industrializing nation, though not without the problems of extensive corruption and popular discontent. After a wave of protests demanding democracy, Suharto stepped down, beginning the present period of Indonesian history, known as the Reformation era.   ==Prehistory== [[Image:Floresiensis.jpg|thumb|The skull of ''H. floresiensis''.]] Geologically the area of modern [[Indonesia]] appeared sometime around the [[Pleistocene]] period when it was still linked with the [[Asia]]n mainland. The archipelago formed during the thaw after the latest [[ice age]]. The area's first known humanlike inhabitant some 500,000 years ago was &quot;[[Java Man]]&quot; (first classified as ''[[Pithecanthropus erectus]]'', then subsequently named a part of the species ''[[Homo erectus]]''). Recently discovered was a species of human, dubbed &quot;[[Flores Man]]&quot; (''[[Homo floresiensis]]''), a miniature hominoid that grew only three feet tall. Flores Man seems to have shared some islands with Java Man until only 10,000 years ago, when they became extinct.  ==Early settlement== Indian scholars wrote about the [[Dvipantara]] or [[Jawa Dwipa]] [[Hindu]] kingdom in [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Sumatra]] around [[200 BC]]. The [[Taruma]] kingdom occupied West Jawa around [[400s|400]]. In [[425]] [[Buddhism]] reached the area.  ==Pre-colonial civilizations== By the time of the [[Europe]]an [[Renaissance]], the two largest islands in what is now Indonesia, [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Sumatra]] had already seen over a millennia of civilization and two major empires.   ===Kingdom of Mataram=== ''For full coverage, see [[Kingdom of Mataram]]''  '''Mataram''' was an [[Indianized kingdom]] based in Central Java (the area surrounding modern-day [[Yogjakarta]]) between the 8th and 10th centuries CE.  The centre of the kingdom was moved from Central Java to East Java by [[Mpu Sindok]]. The move may have been caused by an eruption of the volcano [[Mount Merapi, Central Java|Mount Merapi]], or a power struggle.  The first king of Mataram was [[Sanjaya]], who  drove the [[Sailendra]]s from Java and left inscriptions in stone. The monumental [[Hindu]] temple of [[Prambanan]] in the vicinity of [[Yogyakarta]] was built by [[Daksa]].

[[Image:Edward S. Curtis Collection People 043.jpg|left|thumb|Traditional Hopi hair style, photo by Edward S. Curtis, 1922]]Hair grows from all areas of the skin on humans regardless of sex or race except in the following locations: the lips, the nipples, the palms of hands, the soles of feet, certain external genital areas, the navel and other scar tissue.  Some people seem to have less body and facial hair than others, but in fact have shorter and finer body hair while the total number of follicles is relatively constant.  Several theories have been advanced to explain the apparent bareness of human body hair. One suggests that nature selected humans for shorter and thinner body hair as part of a set of adaptations including [[bipedal]] locomotion and an upright posture. There are several problems with this ''savanna'' theory, not least of which is that [[cursorial hunting]] is used by (other) animals that do not show any thinning of hair, and that hair similar to [[chimpanzee]]s and [[gorilla]]s also shades the skin from radiant heat and protects it from hot winds, and thus another mechanism for heat loss is not required. Another problem is that bipedal locomotion apparently now predates hominids moving from a forest environment to a savanna environment. A more recent theory for human hair loss has to do with a possible period of bipedal wading in a salt marsh in the Danakil region of [[Ethiopia]], possibly occurring in the hominid lineage between 5 and 7 million years ago. As a wading animal, it was more efficient to develop short body hair and a layer of subcutaneous fat for streamlining and insulation in the aquatic environment; the eccrine sweat glands developed later after the hominids left the water; see [[Aquatic ape hypothesis]]. One problem with this theory is that both chimpanzees and gorillas have the same density and distribution of the eccrine glands, but that they have not been developed for sweat production.   A ''third'' theory for the thin body hair on humans proposes that [[Fisherian runaway]] [[sexual selection]] played a role here (as well as in the selection of long head hair). Possibly this occurred in conjunction with [[neoteny]], with the more juvenile appearing females being selected by males as more desirable; see [[#Types_of_hair|types of hair]] and [[vellus hair]]. The human female body hair typically has more [[vellus hair]] (making the skin appear bare), while the male body typically has more terminal hair (especially on the chest and back). Thus [[sexual selection]] can explain the [[sexual dimorphism]] in human body hair, with the results of selection being more evident (more extreme) in the female than in the male, a point which the other two theories cannot address without proposing substantially different behavior between males and females.

Examples include Sierra Nevada Bigfoot (bittering only),   '''Pacific Gem''' â High alpha variety from New Zealand, but also contributes a berryish aroma. This, along with Hallertauer, are frequently organically grown in New Zealand, so this is most likely to be found in organic beers outside of NZ. Has a woody, berryish note.   '''Perle''' â One of the least distinctive German hops, the dual-purpose Perle is often found in conjunction with other hops.   '''Pride of Ringwood''' - Ubiquitous Australian hop. At one time, this was a high-alpha variety, but has been long surpassed. Considered by some rather malodorous, PoR hasn't caught on outside of the Australian lager world.   '''Progress''' â Developed as a replacement for Fuggles, this has a higher alpha rating, and is often found in combination with Goldings.

It used to be the most widespread sport on the Isle of Man but it ceased to be played after the introduction of [[football]], until very recently when it has been somewhat revived.  It involves a [[hockey stick|stick]] (cammag) and a [[ball]] (crick) with anything between four and hundreds of players!  Sometimes whole towns and villages took part, or even played each other. The cammag can be any stick with a bent end and the crick can be made from cork or wood.  Old accounts tell us that it was occasionally covered in a rag to make it less painful to hit.  Cammag season started on Hunt the Wren day (26th [[December]]) and was only played by men (of all ages) during the winter.  Realistically it ceased to be played about 1900, however today an annual match of cammag is played in [[St. John's, Isle of Man|St. John's]] (Balley Keill Eoin).  As there are no rules to cammag a trip to the local [inn]] is advised to ease any feelings of cowardice beforehand!  ===Football=== [[Football (soccer)|Football]] is also popular, with the [[Isle of Man Football Association]] running an [[Isle of Man Football League|football league]] of 27 clubs in two divisions, as well as an [[Isle of Man Football Combination|football combination]] for the reserve teams of the league clubs. There is also an [[Isle of Man national football team|national football team]], although it does not participate in [[UEFA]] or [[FIFA]] tournaments.  An article on football can be found at [[Isle of Man national football team]]  ===Rugby=== There are a number of [[Rugby Union]] clubs that participate in the English rugby scene, such as [[Douglas R.U.F.C.]]; [[Castletown R.U.F.C.]]; [[Southern Nomads R.U.F.C.]]; and [[Vagabonds R.U.F.C.]]. It would be possible to enter an Isle of Man Sevens rugby team in the Commonwealth Games.  ===Basketball=== [[Basketball]] is also played in the Isle of Man.   ===Hockey=== There are many Manx [[Field hockey|hockey]] teams, with mixed, mens' and ladies' leagues. See [http://www.manxhockey.com Manx hockey website].   ===Cricket=== The [[Isle of Man Cricket Association]] broke their affiliation with the Lancashire Cricket Board in 2004 to become affiliate members of the [[International Cricket Council]] and compete as a national team in their own right.  ===Gymnastics=== The Isle of Man hosts very successful Men's and Women's [[gymnastics]] teams, which consist of gymnasts solely from [http://www.manxgymnastics.co.uk Manx Gymnastics]. Recent accomplishments include 2001, 2003 and 2005 [[Island Games]], the latest of which the gymnastics team came away with 29 medals, including 15 golds out of the total of 34 that the Isle of Man team [http://www.islandgames.net/content/members/iom.html] won. Manx Gymnastics sent a number of gymnasts to the [[2004 Junior Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]], and plan to send more to the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]].  ===Chess=== [[Mot= gi aict  *itrd gai   r eeay

Generated seq by model:- al or inanimate thing to act in a certain way.  The shaman (Inuktitut: ''angakuq'', sometimes spelled ''angakok'') of a community of Inuit was not the leader, but rather a sort of healer and psychotherapist, who tended wounds and offered advice, as well as invoking the spirits to assist people in their lives.  His or her role was to see, interpret and exhort the subtle and unseen.  Shamans were not trained, they were held to be born with the ability.    Inuit religion was closely tied to a system of rituals that were integrated into the daily life of the people. These rituals were not terribly complicated, but they were held to be absolutely necessary.  According to a customary Inuit saying ''&quot;The great peril of our existence lies in the fact that our diet consists entirely of souls.&quot;''  By believing that all things - including animals - have souls like those of humans, any hunt that fails to show appropriate respect and customary supplication would only give the liberated spirits cause to avenge themselves.    The harshness and randomness of life in the Arctic ensured that Inuit lived constantly in fear of the uncontrollable, where a streak of bad luck could kill an entire community.  To offend a spirit was to run the risk of having them interfere with an already marginal existence.  The Inuit plead with supernatural powers to provide them with the necessities of day-to-day survival.  As [[Knud Rasmussen]]'s Inuit guide told him when asked about Inuit religious beliefs ''&quot;We don't believe. We fear!.&quot;''  ==Early history of the Inuit== The Inuit are the descendents of what [[anthropologist]]s call the [[Thule people|Thule culture]], a nomadic people who emerged from western [[Alaska]] around [[1000]] and spread eastwards across the Arctic, displacing the related [[Dorset (culture)|Dorset culture]] (in Inuktitut, the ''Tuniit'').  Inuit legends speak of the Tuniit as &quot;giants&quot;, people who were taller and stronger than the Inuit, but who were easily scared off and retreated from the advancing Inuit. Researchers believe that the Dorset culture lacked dogs, boats and other technologies that gave the expanding Inuit society a large advantage over them.  By [[1300]], the Inuit had settled west [[Greenland]], and finally moved into east Greenland over the following century.  The Tuniit survived in [[Aivilik]] - [[Southampton Island|Southampton]] and [[Coats Island]]s - until the beginning of the [[20th century]].  They were known as ''Sadlermiut'' (''Sallirmiut'' in the modern spelling).  Their population had been decimated by diseases brought by contact with Europeans, and the last of them fell in a flu epidemic caught from a passing whaler in [[1902]].  The area has since been resettled by Inuit.  Genetic research suggests that there was little or no intermarriage between the Tuniit and the Inuit over the thousand years of contact in the Canadian Arctic.  The Inuit were a nomadic culture that circulated almost exclusively north of the [[tree-line|timberline]], the ''de facto'' southern border ofa-*eii_TmÃiMn!!9-&kÒæ]8¿=5G

Work on the project started on [[July 7]], [[1930]].  At the official beginning of the project on [[September 17]], [[1930]], President Hoover's [[Secretary of the Interior]] [[Ray L. Wilbur]], announced that the new dam on the Colorado River would be named Hoover Dam to honor the then President of the United States.  Wilbur followed a long-standing tradition of naming important dams after the President who was in office when they were constructed, such as Wilson Dam and Coolidge Dam.  Furthermore, Hoover was already campaigning for re-election in the face of the Depression and sought credit for creating jobs.  A Congressional Act of [[February 14]], [[1931]], made the name &quot;Hoover Dam&quot; official.  In 1932, Hoover lost his bid for reelection to [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]].  When Roosevelt took office on [[March 4]], [[1933]], and he brought [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]] with him to replace Ray Lyman Wilbur as Secretary of the Interior.  Ickes wasted no time removing Hooverâs name from the Boulder Canyon Project.  On May 8, 1933, Ickes issued a memorandum to the Bureau of Reclamation, which was in charge of the dam, stating, &quot;I have your reference to the text for the pamphlet descriptive of the Boulder Canyon Project for use at the Century of Progress Exposition.  I would be glad if you will refer to the dam as 'Boulder Dam' in this pamphlet as well as in correspondence and other referend]-:Ã1za:g] Bm   ]:]Ã8-1giE7]B

ICANN is headquartered in Marina del Rey, California, but is overseen by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and non-commercial communities.  The US government continues to have a privileged role in approving changes to the root zone file that lies at the heart of the domain name system.  Because the Internet is a distributed network comprising many voluntarily interconnected networks, the Internet, as such, has no governing body.  ICANN's role in coordinating the assignment of unique identifiers distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body on the global Internet, but the scope of its authority extends only to the Internet's systems of domain names, Internet protocol addresses, and protocol port and parameter numbers.  ==Internet culture== The Internet is also having a profound impact on [[career|work]], [[leisure]], [[knowledge]] and [[worldview]]s.  [[Image:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|300px|Graphic representation of a very small part of the [[World Wide Web|WWW]], representing some of the [[hyperlink]]s]]  ===The World Wide Web=== {{main|World Wide Web}} Through [[keyword]]-driven [[Internet research]] using [[search engine]]s like [[Google (search engine)|Google]], millions worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to [[encyclopaedia]]s and traditional [[library|libraries]], the World Wide Web has enabled a sudden and extreme decentralization of information and data.  Some companies and individuals have adopted the use of 'weblogs' or [[blog]]s, which are largely used as easily-updatable online diaries.  Some commercial organizations encourage staff to fill them with advice on their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result. One example of this practice is [[Microsoft]], whose product [[developer]]s publish their personal blogs in order to pique the public's interest in their work.  For more information on the distinction between the World Wide Web and the Internet itself â as in everyday use the two are sometimes confused â see [[Dark internet]] where this is discussed in more detail.  ===Remote access=== The Internet allows computer users to connect to other computers and information stores easily, wherever they may be across the world. They may do this with or without the use of security, authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements.  This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries.

The Hollywood style is also a &quot;slotted&quot; dance, meaning the follow travels in a straight line instead of the more elliptical or circular Savoy style [[Lindy Hop]].  Proponents of the Hollywood Style Lindy Hop often say they're able to dance faster because of the use of counterbalance techniques, and people watching often remark at the smooth nature of the style.  Much of this impression comes about because of the two dimensional nature of film.  All the motion had to be captured in the two available dimensions whereas the Savoy Style is more of a three dimensional dance making it more difficult to present effectively on film.  The film [[Hellzapoppin']] has examples of [[Dean Collins]] doing the Hollywood Style, and [[Frankie Manning]] as part of [[Whitey's Lindy Hoppers]] doing the Savoy Style.  Other names for Hollywood Style often used by instructors other than Erik Robison and Sylvia Skylar:  Smooth Style, LA Style, Dean Style, Collins Style, and often incorrectly as West Coast Swing.

Nearby highways were at a standstill; approaching the store from less than 1 mile took upwards of an hour.  IKEA employees indicated that on the first Saturday of operation, the Stoughton store would have sales of $1-1.2M.  Over 300,000 visitors were expected on the first weekend of operation.  IKEA was vetoed planning permission for a further store in England in 2004 (to be based in [[Stockport]] in [[Greater Manchester]]) by the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]].  It applied for [[judicial review]] but lost in 2005. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4278539.stm] [http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/news/s/125/125859_fury_as_prescott_blocks_ikea_store.html]  In January 2006 it announced plans to create 10 extra smaller outlets, to be based in city centres.  The first of these will be in [[Coventry]]. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4598068.stm]  == Store format ==  Newer IKEA stores are usually very large blue boxes with few windows. They are often designed around a mandatory &quot;one-way&quot; layout which forces consumers to traverse nearly all parts of the store before reaching the [[cashier]] or [[Point of sale#Traditional stores|check-out stands]]. The sequence involves going through furniture showrooms (showroom) and housewares (market-hall) first, then the warehouse where one collects flatpacks for products seen in the showrooms, and then the cashier.  This design is intended to make customers encounter products which they might not have thought to look for, but has the disadvantage of inconveniencing consumers who already know what they want to buy and just want to return to the warehouse area.  Recently, in some stores, shortcuts have been introduced between various sections, making travel time through the store much shorter if necessary. However, though they may be indicated on store maps, these shortcuts are often not obvious so an inexperienced IKEA shopper is likely to overlook them and travel through the whole layout of the store. In addition, the shortcuts are heavily criticized for not being long enough for convenience.    Whilst the original design involved the warehouse on the lower level and the showroom and markethall on the upper, some stores are single-level bungalow-style stores while many U.S. stores place the showroom upstairs and the marketplace and warehouse both downstairs. Some stores&lt;!-- Most U.S. stores? --&gt; operate separate additional warehouses for the larger or less popular flatpacks to keep the size of the customer warehouse down (and therefore less daunting) and allow more stock to be kept on-site at any given time.

Generated seq by model:- ht posture. There are several problems with this ''savanna'' theory, not least of which is that [[cursorial hunting]] is used by (other) animals that do not show any thinning of hair, and that hair similar to [[chimpanzee]]s and [[gorilla]]s also shades the skin from radiant heat and protects it from hot winds, and thus another mechanism for heat loss is not required. Another problem is that bipedal locomotion apparently now predates hominids moving from a forest environment to a savanna environment. A more recent theory for human hair loss has to do with a possible period of bipedal wading in a salt marsh in the Danakil region of [[Ethiopia]], possibly occurring in the hominid lineage between 5 and 7 million years ago. As a wading animal, it was more efficient to develop short body hair and a layer of subcutaneous fat for streamlining and insulation in the aquatic environment; the eccrine sweat glands developed later after the hominids left the water; see [[Aquatic ape hypothesis]]. One problem with this theory is that both chimpanzees and gorillas have the same density and distribution of the eccrine glands, but that they have not been developed for sweat production.   A ''third'' theory for the thin body hair on humans proposes that [[Fisherian runaway]] [[sexual selection]] played a role here (as well as in the selection of long head hair). Possibly this occurred in conjunction with [[neoteny]], with the more juvenile appearing females being selected by males as more desirable; see [[#Types_of_hair|types of hair]] and [[vellus hair]]. The human female body hair typically has more [[vellus hair]] (making the skin appear bare), while the male body typically has more terminal hair (especially on the chest and back). Thus [[sexual selection]] can explain the [[sexual dimorphism]] in human body hair, with the results of selection being more evident (more extreme) in the female than in the male, a point which the other two theories cannot address without proposing substantially different behavior between males and females. Also, we see that artificially bare (shaved, etc.) legs, arms, etc. on women are seen as &quot;sexy&quot; even today, while body shaving is not nearly as common for men.  ==Structure== [[Image:Female brunette.jpg|right|170px|thumb|Hair with a round cross-section will fall straight, as opposed to curly hair, which has a flat cross-section]] Hair consists 90% of a [[biology|biological]] [[polymer]], [[keratin|&amp;alpha;-keratin]], and about 10% [[water]], which modifies its mechanical properties.

Several of these associate to form one strand of hair, which is covered with tiny surface scales.

It is located in [[Bures-sur-Yvette]] just south of [[Paris]].   The IHÃS, founded in 1958 by businessman and mathematician [[LÃ©on Motchane]] with the help of [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Jean DieudonnÃ©]], aims to bring together top researchers in the field. It has a small number of permanent professors, appointed for life, and invites about 200 visitors a year for varying terms averaging three months. It also has a small number of so-called long-term visitors. Research is not contracted or directed: it is left to each individual researcher to pursue their own goals. Permanent professors are only required to be in residence six months a year.  Design of the IHÃS is said to be influenced by Robert Oppenheimer, who was then the Director of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton. The strong personality of [[Alexandre Grothendieck]] and the broad sweep of his revolutionizing theories were a dominating feature of the first ten years at the IHÃS. [[RenÃ© Thom]] was another prominent figure in its early history. [[Dennis Sullivan]] is remembered as one who had a special talent for encouraging fruitful exchanges among visitors and provoking a new and deeper insight into their ideas.

Even though being a neighbour to the mighty Soviet Union sometimes resulted in overmuch caution concerning [[Foreign relations of Finland|foreign politics]] (&quot;[[Finlandization]]&quot;), Finland developed closer cooperation with the other [[Nordic country|Nordic countries]] and declared her [[neutralist|neutrality]] in regard to superpower politics.  :''See also [[Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance]]''  In [[1952]], Finland and the countries of the [[Nordic Council]] entered into a passport union, allowing their citizens to cross borders without passports and soon also to apply for jobs and claim social security benefits in the other countries. Many from Finland used this opportunity to get better paid jobs in Sweden in the 1950s and 1960s, dominating Sweden's first wave of post-war labor immigration. Although Finnish wages or standard of living could not compete with wealthy Sweden until the 1980s, the Finnish economy rose remarkably well from the ashes of World War II, resulting in the buildup of another Nordic-style welfare state.  Despite the passport union with Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland Finland could not join the [[Nordic Council]] until 1955 because of Soviet fears that Finland might become too closely related to the West. Back then the Soviet Union saw the [[Nordic Council]] as part of [[NATO]] with Denmark and Norway being members of it.  During the same year Finland could join the [[United Nations]], though it had already been associated with a lot of the UN's suborganisations. The first Finnish ambassador to the UN was G.A. Gripenberg (1956-1959), followed by Ralph Enckell (1959-1965), Max Jakobson (1965-1972), Aarno Karhilo (1972-1977), Ilkka Pastinen (1977-1983), Keijo Korhonen (1983-1988), Klaus TÃ¶rnudd (1988-1991), Wilhelm Breitenstein (1991-1998) and Marjatta Rasi (since 1998). Max Jakobson even was a candidate for [[Secretary-General]] of the UN in 1972.  In another remarkable event of 1955, the Soviet Union decided to return the [[Porkkala]] peninsula to Finland, which had been rented to the Soviet Union in 1948 for 50 years as a military base and was somewhat endangering the sovereignty and neutrality of Finland.  Finland became an associate member of the [[European Free Trade Association]] in [[1961]] and a full member in [[1986]]. A trade agreement with the [[EEC]] was complemented by another with the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]]. The first Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), that started developments leading to [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], was held in Finland [[1972]]-[[1973]]. In Finland, CSCE was widely considered as a possible means of reducing the tensions of the Cold War, and a personal triumph for President [[Urho Kekkonen|Kekkonen]].  The post-war period was a time of rapid economic growth and increasing social and political stability for Finland.

Throughout the world, illness has often been attributed to [[witchcraft]], [[demons]], averse [[Astrology|astral influence]], or the will of the [[gods]], ideas that retain some power, with [[faith healing]] and [[shrine]]s still common, although the rise of scientific medicine in the past two centuries has altered or replaced many historic health practices.  {{histOfScience}} ==General review of the history of medicine == ===Egyptian medicine=== ''See main article: [[Ancient Egyptian medicine]].''  Medical information contained in the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] date as early as [[3000 BC]] ([http://www.arabworldbooks.com/articles8.htm]). The earliest known [[surgery]] was performed in [[History of Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] around [[2800 BC|2750 BC]] (see [[surgery]]). [[Imhotep]] in the [[Third dynasty of Egypt|3rd dynasty]] is credited as the founder of ancient Egyptian medicine and as the original author of the Edwin Smith [[papyrus]], detailing cures, ailments and [[anatomical]] observations. The Edwin Smith papyrus is regarded as a copy of several earlier works and was written circa [[1600s BC|1600 BC]]. It is an ancient textbook on surgery and describes in exquisite detail the ''examination, diagnosis, treatment,'' and ''prognosis'' of numerous ailments ([http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9032043&amp;query=Edwin%20Smith%20papyrus&amp;ct=]).    Additionally, the [[Ebers papyrus]] (c. [[16th century BC|1550 BC]]) is full of incantations and foul applications meant to turn away disease-causing demons and other superstition, in it there is evidence of a ''long tradition of empirical practice and observation.''{{fact}} The Ebers papyrus also provides our earliest documentation of a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] awareness of [[tumor]]s{{fact}}.  Medical institutions are known to have been established in [[ancient Egypt]] since as early as the [[First dynasty of Egypt|1st Dynasty]]{{fact}}. By the time of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th Dynasty]] their employees enjoyed such benefits as [[medical insurance]], [[pensions]] and [[sick leave]]. Employees worked 8 hours per day [http://www.arabworldbooks.com/articles8c.htm].  The earliest known physician is also credited to [[History of Ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]]: [[Hesyre]], âChief of Dentists and Physiciansâ for King [[Djoser]] in the [[27th century BC]] [http://www.arabworldbooks.com/articles8c.htm]. Also, the earliest known woman physician, [[Peseshet]], practiced in [[Ancient Egypt]] at the time of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]]. Her title was âLady Overseer of the Lady Physicians.â In addition to her supervisory role, Peseshet graduated midwives at an ancient Egyptian medical school in [[Sais]] (see [http://www.arabworldbooks.com/articles8c.htm ''Medicine In Ancient Egypt, page 3'']).

After the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, Sweden was ranked among the great European powers (the [[Swedish Empire]]). During the war, several important reforms had been made in Finland: *[[1637]]-[[1640|40]] and [[1648]]-[[1654|54]] Count [[Per Brahe]] functioned as general governor of Finland. Many important reforms were made and many towns were founded. His period of administration is generally considered very beneficial to the development of Finland. *[[1640]] Finland's first university, the [[Academy of Ãbo]], was founded in Turku at the proposal of Count Per Brahe by [[Queen Christina of Sweden]]. This is said to be the only European university founded by a female. *[[1642]] The whole [[Bible]] was finally published in Finnish.  However, the high taxation, continuing wars and the cold climate (the [[Little Ice Age]]) made the Imperial era of Sweden rather gloomy times for Finnish peasants. In 1655 - 1660, a [[Northern Wars|new series of bitter wars]] was fought, taking Finnish soldiers to the battle-fields of [[Livonia]], [[Poland]] and [[Denmark]]. In 1676, the political system of Sweden was transformed into an [[Charles XI of Sweden|absolute monarchy]].   In Middle and Eastern Finland, great amounts of [[tar]] were produced for export. European nations needed this material for the maintenance of their fleets. According to some theories, the spirit of early [[capitalism]] in the tar-producing province of [[Pohjanmaa]] may have been the reason for the [[witch-hunt]] wave that happened in this region during the late 17th century. The people were developing more expectations and plans for the future, and when these were not realized, they were quick to blame witches - according to a belief system the [[Lutheran]] church had imported from [[Germany]].    In the religious sense, the 17th century was an era of very strict [[Lutheran]] orthodoxy.  In 1697-9, a famine caused by climate killed approximately 30 % of the Finnish population. Soon afterwards, another war determining Finland's fate began (the [[Great Northern War]] of 1700-21).  ==The 18th century - the Age of Reason== During the [[Great Northern War]] ([[1700]]&amp;ndash;[[1721]]), Finland was occupied by the Russians, and the [[Old Finland|south-eastern part]], including the important town of [[Viipuri]], was annexed to [[Russia]] after the [[Peace of Nystad|peace of Uusikaupunki]]. The border with Russia came to lie roughly where it returned to after [[World War II]]. Sweden's status as a European [[great power]] was gone, and Russia was now the leading might of the North. The [[absolute monarchy]] was finished in Sweden.

Meanwhile, the socialists in Petrograd had formed a soviet (council) of workers and soldiers' deputies to provide them with the power that they lacked in the Duma.  In July, the head of the provisional government resigned and was succeeded by [[Alexander Kerensky]], who was more progressive than his predecessor but not radical enough for the Bolsheviks. While Kerensky's government marked time, the Marxist soviet in Petrograd extended its organization throughout the country by setting up local soviets. Meanwhile, Kerensky made the fatal mistake of continuing to commit Russia to the war, a policy extremely unpopular with the masses.  Lenin returned to Russia from exile in [[Switzerland]], with the help of Germany, which hoped that widespread strife would cause Russia to withdraw from the war. A tumultuous reception by thousands of peasants, workers, and soldiers took place as Lenin's train rolled into the station. After many behind-the-scenes maneuvers, the soviets seized control of the government in November 1917, and drove Kerensky and his moderate provisional government into exile, in the events that would become known as the [[October Revolution]].  When the national assembly, which met in January [[1918]], refused to become a rubber-stamp of the Bolsheviks, it was dissolved by Lenin's troops. With the dissolution of the constituent assembly, all vestiges of bourgeois democracy were removed. With the handicap of the moderate opposition removed, Lenin was able to free his regime from the war problem by the harsh [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] (1918) with Germany, with great sacrifice of Russian territory.  ==Russian Civil War== ''Main article: [[Russian Civil War]]''  A powerful group of counterrevolutionaries termed the [[White movement]] began to organize to topple the Bolsheviks. At the same time the Allied powers sent several expeditionary armies to Russia to support the anti-Communist forces. The Allies feared that the Bolsheviks were in a conspiracy with the Germans because of Brest-Litovsk; they also hoped that the White Russians might renew hostilities against Germany. In the fall of 1918 the Bolshevik regime was in a perilous position, opposed by Russia's former allies and internal enemies, as well as in sporadic conflict with short-lived nationalist republics in Belarus and Ukraine and anarchist forces.  To counteract this emergency, a reign of terror was begun within Russia as the [[Red Army]] and the [[Cheka]] (the secret police) destroyed all enemies of the revolution. However lofty their goals were, the Bolsheviks did not have the consent of all elements of society and thus had to force their rule over Russia during the civil war. They swept away the tsarist secret police, so despised by Russians of all political persuasions, along with other tsarist institutions, but ensured the survival of their own regime by replacing it with a political police of considerablecvyvÙµvoy°µts°£ hoà§

Generated seq by model:- nto the delivery pipe. Since this water is being forced uphill through the delivery pipe farther than it is falling downhill from the source, the flow slows down and when it reverses the delivery check valve closes. If all water flow has stopped, the loaded waste valve reopens against the now [[hydrostatic pressure|static head]], allowing the process to begin again.  A common refinement is to add a pressure vessel containing some air between the pump and the delivery pipe. This cushions the shock when the waste valve closes and improves the efficiency by allowing a more constant flow through the delivery pipe. In a similar way a supply pipe and a [[barrel]] or a stand pipe may be added above the drive pipe so that the drive pipe does not have to be made too long. The optimum length of the drive pipe is 5 to 12 times the vertical distance between the source and the pump, or 500 to 1000 times the diameter of the drive pipe, whichever is less. This length of drive pipe typically results in a period between pulses of 1 to 2 seconds. A typical efficiency is 60%, but up to 80% is possible.  ===Common operational problems=== Some common operational problems are intrusion of air into the drive pipe, blockage of the intake or valves with debris, knocking due to too little air in the pressure vessel, and freezing in winter.   ==External links== *[http://www.clemson.edu/irrig/Equip/ram.htm Details of how to make a homemade hydraulic ram] *[http://www.greenandcarter.com/ Green and Carter] *[http://cooperage.ne-design.net/ram-pump.html What is a Ram Pump?]  [[Category:Pumps]] [[Category:Water]]  [[cs:VodnÃ­ trkaÄ]] [[de:Hydraulischer Widder]] [[he:×××× × ××××¨×××××ª]] [[sv:VÃ¤durspump]]</text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>Heresy</title>     <id>14341</id>     <revision>       <id>42084427</id>       <timestamp>2006-03-03T18:49:36Z</timestamp>       <contributor>         <ip>168.224.1.14</ip>       </contributor>       <text xml:space="preserve">'''Heresy''', according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], is a &quot;theological or religious opinion or [[doctrine]] maintained in opposition, or held to be contrary, to the [[Catholic]] or [[Orthodox]] doctrine of the Christian Church, or, by extension, to that of any church, creed, or religious system, considered as orthodox.

This is why Forensic Hypnosis is not widely used in many countries' legal systems.  ===Clinical Hypnosis=== The [[American Society of Clinical Hypnosis]] is an organization that &quot;promotes greater acceptance of hypnosis as a clinical tool with broad applications&quot;. Hypnosis is applied to a great range of both physical and psychological ailments, rather than being restricted to purely psychological phenomena. The society was founded by [[Milton Erickson]], a doctor who attempted to put hypnosis on a firm therapeutic backing in the [[1950]]s.   The late Milton H. Erickson's short-sightedness in wishing only board licensed healthcare professionals to have the right of therapeutic hypnotism practice has repeatedly caused difficulty for certified laymen in the field of hypnotism; eventually causing a redefinition of the type of hypnotism practiced by certified lay hypnotists. Such certified laymen, at least in practice of hypnotism in the United States, are now said to do &quot;non-therapeutic issue-resolution hypnotism&quot;, rather than hypnotherapy. [http://www.ngh.net/CodeEthicsStandards.pdf] (This paragraph entered by Jocelyn L. H. Jensen-Worthington, C.HT, 02/24/06)   Recently, efforts to reduce obesity with hypnosis (when used in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy, exercise, and a low-fat diet) have been effective in most cases[http://www.umm.edu/altmed/ConsConditions/Obesitycc.html].  ===Self-hypnosis=== {{main|Autosuggestion}} Self-hypnosis&amp;mdash; (or [[autosuggestion]]) hypnosis in which a person hypnotizes himself without the assistance of another person to serve as the hypnotist&amp;mdash;is a staple of hypnotherapy-related [[self-help]] programs. It is most often used to help the self-hypnotist stay on a [[Dieting|diet]], overcome [[cigarette|smoking]] or some other [[addiction]], or to generally boost the hypnotized person's [[self-esteem]]. It is rarely used for the more complex or [[controversy|controversial]] uses of hypnotism, which require the hypnotist to monitor the hypnotized person's reactions and responses and respond accordingly. Most people who practice self-hypnosis require a focus for their [[attention]] in order to become fully hypnotized; there are many [[computer program]]s on the market that can ostensibly help in this area, though few, if any, have been scientifically proven to aid self-hypnosis.   Some people use devices known as mind machines to help them go into self-hypnosis more readily. A mind machine consists of glasses with different colored flashing LEDs on the inside, and headphones. The LEDs stimulate the visual channel while the headphones stimulate the audio channel with similar or slightly different frequencies designed to produce a certain mental state. A common occurrence is the use of binaural beats in the audio which is said to produce hypnosis more readily.  ===Dental Application===  The use of hypnosis in dentistry has a long history.

This affected the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the language, and Korean phonology described it in terms of ''yin'' and ''yang'': If a word had ''yang'' ('bright') vowels, then most suffixes also had to have a ''yang'' vowel; and conversely, if the root had ''yin'' ('dark') vowels, the suffixes needed to be ''yin'' as well. There was a harmonic third group called &quot;mediating&quot; ('neutral' in Western terminology) that could coexist with either ''yin'' or ''yang'' vowels.   The Korean neutral vowel was ã£ ''i''. The ''yin'' vowels were ã¡ãã ''eu, u, eo''; the dots are in the ''yin'' directions of 'down' and 'left'. The ''yang'' vowels were ããã, ''É, o, a'', with the dots in the ''yang'' directions of 'up' and 'right'. As mentioned above, the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum'' states that the shapes of the non-dotted ''jamo'' ã¡ãã£ were also chosen to represent the concepts of ''yin'', ''yang'', and mediation. (The dot ã ''É'' is now obsolete.)   There was yet a third parameter for designing the vowel ''jamo'': namely, choosing ã¡ as the graphic base of ã and ã, and ã£ as the base of ã and ã. A full understanding of what these horizontal and vertical groups had in common would require knowing the exact sound values these vowels had in the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Our uncertainty is primarily with the ''jamo'' ããã. Some linguists reconstruct these as {{IPA|*a, *É¤, *e}}, respectively; others as {{IPA|*É, *e, *a}}. However, the horizontal ''jamo'' ã¡ãã do appear to have all been mid to high back vowels, {{IPA|[*É¯, *u, *o]}}.  ====Ledyard's theory of consonant ''jamo'' design==== [[Image:Phagspa-Hangul comparison.png|thumb|240px| (Top) Phagspa letters {{IPA|[k, t, p, s, l]}}, and their supposed hangul derivatives {{IPA|[k, t, p, ts, l]}}.

Although none have wide acceptance, Professor [[Gari Ledyard]] of Columbia University believes that five consonants were derived from the Mongol [[Phagspa]] alphabet of the [[Yuan dynasty]], and the rest derived internally, essentially as described in the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum''. However, these basic consonants were not the graphically simplest letters of the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum'', but the basic consonants in Chinese phonology.  The ''Hunmin Jeong-eum'' states that King Sejong adapted å¤ç¯ &quot;''GÇ'' script(s)&quot; in creating hangul. The primary meaning of å¤ is ''old'', frustrating philologists because hangul bears no functional similarity to Chinese ç¯å­ [[seal script]]s.

Generated seq by model:- red with a brine, either by immersion or injection.  The division between wet and dry cure is not always hard-and-fast as some ham curing methods begin wet but are followed by dry aging.  The majority of common wet-cured ham available in U.S. supermarkets is of the &quot;city ham&quot; variety, in which brine is injected into the meat for a very rapid curing suitable for mass market.  Traditional wet curing requires immersing the ham in a brine for an extended period, often followed by light smoking.  Traditional wet cured ham includes the [[England|English]] ''Wiltshire ham''.  Dry-cured varieties include ''[[prosciutto]] crudo'' (the [[Italy|Italian]] style of dry-cured ham) and ''Parma ham'' or ''prosciutto di Parma'' (''prosciutto crudo'' from the city of [[Parma]]).  Spain has ''[[jamÃ³n serrano]]'' and jamÃ³n iberico.  The United States has ''country ham'' (including ''Virginia ham''), which is smoked.  [[England]] has the ''York ham''. [[Germany]]'s ''Westphalian ham'' is usually smoked over [[juniper]].  Ham is also processed into other meat products such as [[SPAM]] luncheon meat. Baked ham is also a traditional dish served on Easter.  ==National regulation of ham production== Each country that produces ham has its own regulations.   ===USA=== In the United States, ham is regulated primarily on the basis of its cure and water content.  US law (specifically the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]) recognizes the following categories:  Fresh ham is an uncured hind leg of pork. Country Ham is uncooked, cured, dried, smoked-or-unsmoked, made from a single piece of meat from the hind leg of a hog or from a single piece of meat from a pork shoulder.  [[Smithfield ham]], a country ham, must be made in or around [[Smithfield, Virginia]] to be sold as such. [[image:ham.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Sliced ham]] For most other purposes, under US law, a &quot;ham&quot; is a cured hind leg of pork that is at least 20.5% [[protein]] (not counting [[fat]] portions) and contains no added water.  However &quot;ham&quot; can be legally applied to such things as &quot;[[turkey (food)|turkey]] ham&quot; if the meat is taken from the thigh of the animal. If the ham has less than 20.5% but is at least 18.5% protein, it can be called &quot;ham with natural juices&quot;.  A ham that is at least 17.0% protein and up to 10% added solution can be called &quot;ham&amp;mdash;water added&quot;.  Finally, &quot;ham and water product&quot; refers to a cured hind leg of pork product that contains any amount of added water, although the label must indicate the percent added ingredients.  If a ham has been cut into pieces and molded, it must be labeled &quot;sectioned and formed&quot; or &quot;chunked and formed&quot;.  In addition to the main categories, some processing choices can affect legal labeling.  A &quot;smoked&quot; ham must have been smoked by hanging over burning wood chips in a [[smokehouse]], and a &quot;[[hickory]]-smoked&quot; ham must have been smoked over hickory.

Generated seq by model:- the battle against Hus's teaching after the enactments of the Council of Constance. He intended to eradicate completely the doctrine of Hus. For this purpose the co-operation of King Wenceslaus had to be obtained. In 1418 Sigismund succeeded in winning his brother over to the standpoint of the council by pointing out the inevitability of a religious war if the heretics in Bohemia found further protection. Hussite statesmen and army leaders had to leave the country, and Roman priests were reinstituted. These measures caused a general commotion which hastened the death of Wenceslaus by a paralytic stroke in 1419. His heir was Sigismund.  == Two Parties in Bohemia== Hussism had organized itself during the years 1415-1419. From the beginning two parties were found: the closer adherents of Hus clung to his standpoint, leaving the whole hierarchical and liturgical order of the Church untouched; the radical party identified itself more boldly with the doctrines of [[John Wyclif]], shared his passionate hatred of the [[monasticism|monastic]] clergy, and, like him, attempted to lead the Church back to its supposed condition during the time of the apostles, which necessitated the removal of the existing hierarchy and the secularization of ecclesiastical possessions. The radicals among the Hussites sought to translate their theories into reality; they preached the ''sufficientia legis Christi''-- that only the divine law (i.e., the Bible) is the rule and canon for man, and that not only in ecclesiastical matters, but also in political and civil matters. They rejected therefore, as early as 1416, everything that they believed had no basis in the Bible, such as the veneration of saints and images, [[fasting|fasts]], superfluous holidays, the oath, intercession for the dead, auricular confession, [[indulgence]]s, the sacraments of [[Confirmation]] and the [[Anointing of the Sick]]; they admitted laymen and women to the preacher's office, and chose their own priests. But before everything they clung to Wyclif's doctrine of the [[Lord's Supper]], denying [[transubstantiation]], and this is the principal point by which they are distinguished from the moderate party.  == The Four Articles of Prague== The program of the more conservative Hussites is contained in the four articles of [[Prague]], which were agreed upon in July, 1420, and promulgated in the Latin, Czech, and German languages:  #Freedom to preach the Word of God. #Celebration of the Lord's Supper in both kinds (bread and wine to priests and laity alike). #No profane power for the clergy. #The same law for laity and priests. (Please note that this is only a widely accepted abbreviation - the full text of the four articles is about two pages long.)  ==Calixtines or Utraquists, and Taborites== The views of the moderate Hussites were represented at the university and among the citizens of Prague; therefore they were called the Prague party; they were also called Calixtines or [[Utraquists]], because they emphasized the second article, and the chalice became their emblem.

There are unfortunately many vague and untestable theories of hypnosis which continue to circulate, but high quality research is still published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  One fundamental distinction is between 'state' and 'non-state' theories of hypnosis. State theorists believe that an [[altered state of consciousness]] is a core part of hypnosis, whereas non-state theoriests believe that more mundane psychological processess such as focussed attention and expectation are sufficient to explain hypnotic phenomenon. The precise definition of what constitutes an altered state of consciousness is a matter of some debate. Although many people who are hypnotised describe their experience as 'altered' it is difficult to use these terms in the absence of an a priori definition.  One final thing to say about theories is that they can work at different levels of description. Some theories of hypnosis attempt to describe hypnotic phenomenon in terms of brain activity while others concentrate more on the phenomenological experience. Both are valuable and a unified theory is a laudable goal.  === Dissociation and neodissociation theories === [[Pierre Janet]] originally developed the idea of [[dissociation]], literally a splitting-off of some components of consciousness, as a result of his work with hysterical patients. He believed that hypnosis was an example of dissociation: areas of an individual's behavioral control are split off from ordinary awareness. In this case, hypnosis would remove some control from the conscious mind and the individual will respond with autonomic, reflexive behavior. Weitzenhoffer describes hypnosis via this theory as &quot;[[dissociation]] of awareness from the majority of sensory and even strictly neural events taking place.&quot;{{ref|Weitzenhoffer}}  [[Ernest Hilgard]] developed Janet's ideas and published his neodissociation theory in 1977. His theory, a classic 'state' theory, postulated an excutive ego (essentially a central executive system in today's cognitive psychological terms) which became dissociated from sub-components via an 'amnesic barrier'. Suggestions from a hypnotist could produce alterations in perception and behaviour, which were explainable in terms of these dissociated sub-systems. Hilgard's ideas were influenced by his discovery of the 'hidden observer' phenomenon, a process by which different components of consciousness were investigated (other researchers, notably Spanos, believed the hidden observer to be an experimental artifact).  ===Social constructionism / Role-playing theory=== Generally, under hypnosis people become more receptive to suggestion, causing changes in the way they feel, think, and behave. Some psychologists (such as Sarbin and Spanos) have suggested that hypnosis is a social construct, so well-known that strong social expectations are played out by subjects, who believe they are in a state of hypnosis, behaving in a way that they imagine a hypnotized person would behave.

During [[recession]]s there is often strong domestic pressure to increase tariffs to protect domestic industries.  This occurred around the world during the [[Great Depression]] leading to a collapse in world trade that many believe seriously deepened the depression.  The regulation of international trade is done through the World Trade Organization at the global level, and through several other regional arrangements such as MERCOSUR in South America, NAFTA between the United States, Canada and Mexico, and the European Union between 25 independent states. The 2005 Buenos Aires talks on the planned establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), which would have provided common standards for almost all countries in the American continent, failed.  == Risks in international trade == The risks that exist in international trade can be divided into two major groups:  ==== Economic risks ==== *Risk of insolvency of the buyer, *Risk of protracted default - the failure of the buyer to pay the amount due within six months after the due date, and *Risk of non-acceptance *Surrendering [[economic sovereignty]]  ==== Political risks ==== *Risk of cancellation or non-renewal of export or import licences *War risks *Risk of expropriation or confiscation of the importer's company *Risk of the imposition of an import ban after the shipment of the goods *Transfer risk - imposition of exchange controls by the importer's country or foreign [[currency]] shortages *Surrendering [[sovereignty | political sovereignty]]  ==See also== * [[List of international trade topics]] * [[List of economists]] * [[Balance of trade]] * [[Comparative advantage]] * [[Customs union]] * [[Economics]] * [[Free trade]] * [[Free trade area]] * [[Most favoured nation clause]] * [[OPEC]] * [[Trade bloc]] * [[List of countries by imports]] * [[List of countries by exports]]  ==External links== ===Data=== *[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/TRADE/0,,contentMDK:20103741~menuPK:167374~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:239071,00.html World Bank's Trade and Production Database] *[http://www.macalester.edu/research/economics/PAGE/HAVEMAN/Trade.Resources/TradeData.html Resources for data on trade, including the gravity model]   [[Category:International trade]] [[Category:Economics]]  [[de:AuÃenwirtschaft]] [[et:Rahvusvaheline kaubandus]] [[es:Comercio internacional]] [[eo:Internacia komerco]] [[fr:Commerce international]] [[he:×¡××¨ ××× ×××××]] [[nl:Invoer (handel)]] [[no:Internasjonal handel]] [[pt:ImportaÃ§Ã£o]] [[ru:ÐÐ¼Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑ]] [[zh:å½éè´¸æ]]</text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>International Trade/Risks</title>     <id>14568</id>     <revision>       <id>15912113</id>       <timestamp>2002-08-28T06:56:41Z</timestamp>       <contributor>         <username>Au]Psqeme[OUmThrU.e-'earlemntaB

Generated seq by model:- an engine yields two potential benefits: First. the engine can have a larger displacement with smaller individual reciprocating masses (that is, the mass of each piston can be less) thus making a smoother running engine (since the engine tends to vibrate as a result of the pistons moving up and down). Second, with a greater displacement and more pistons, more fuel can be combusted and there can be more combustion events (that is, more power strokes) in a given period of time, meaning that such an engine can generate more torque than a similar engine with fewer cylinders. The down side to having more pistons is that, over all, the engine will tend to weigh more and tend to generate more internal friction as the greater number of pistons rub against the inside of their cylinders. This tends to decrease fuel efficiency and rob the engine of some of its power. For high performance gasoline engines using current materials and technology (such as the engines found in modern automobiles), there seems to be a break point around 10 or 12 cylinders, after which addition of cylinders becomes an overall detriment to performance and efficiency, although exceptions such as the W-16 engine from [[Volkswagen]] exist.  *Most car engines have four to eight cylinders, with some high performance cars having ten, twelve, or even sixteen, and some very small cars and trucks having two or three. In previous years some quite large cars, such as the [[DKW]] and [[Saab 92]], had two cylinder, two stroke engines. *[[Radial engine|Radial]] [[aircraft]] engines, now obsolete, had from five to 28 cylinders. A row contains an odd number of cylinders, so an even number indicates a two- or four-row engine. *[[Motor cycle]]s commonly have from one to four cylinders, with a few high performance models having six. *[[Snowmobile]]s usually have two cylinders. Some larger (not necessarily high-performance, but also touring machines) have four. *Small portable appliances such as [[chainsaw]]s, generators and domestic [[lawn mower]]s most commonly have one cylinder, although two-cylinder chainsaws exist.  ===Ignition system=== Internal combustion engines can be classified by their [[ignition system]]. Today most engines use an [[spark plug|electrical]] or [[compression heating ignition|compression heating]] system for ignition. However [[outside flame ignitor|outside flame]] and [[hot-tube ignitor|hot-tube]] systems have been used historically. [[Nikola Tesla]] gained one of the first patents on the mechanical ignition system with {{US patent|609250}}, &quot;''Electrical Igniter for Gas Engines''&quot;, on [[16 August]] [[1898]].  ===Fuel systems=== Often for simpler reciprocating engines a [[carburetor]] is used to supply fuel into the cylinder. However, exact control of the correct amount of fuel supplied to the engine is impossible.  Larger gasoline engines such as used in cars have mostly moved to [[Fuel injection]] systems. LPG engines use a mix of [[Fuel injection]] systems and closed loop [[carburetor]]s. [[Diesel engines]] always use [[fuel injectima ut  gnbsud a'ntdtab  tyg  h

[[ÃslendingabÃ³k]] (''Libellus Islandorum''), written in 1122-1133 claims that the Norwegian IngÃ³lfur Arnarson was the first man to settle in Iceland ([[ReykjavÃ­k]]) in 870. The families were accompanied by servants and slaves, some of whom were [[Celt]]s or [[Picts]] from Scotland and Ireland (known as ''Westmen'' to the [[Norse]]). Some literary evidence suggests that [[Papar|Irish monks]] may have been living in Iceland before the arrival of Norse settlers, but no archaeological evidence has been found.  [[Erik the Red]], or Eirikr Ãorvaldson, was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter in 980, and set sail for the west, to explore the lands to the west. He established the first settlements in [[Greenland]] around this time, naming the land, according to legend, to attract settlers.  Eirikr's son, [[Leif Ericson|Leifr Eiriksson]], finally set foot in the Americas around the year 1000. While some say he was blown off course, it is most likely that he was deliberately seeking the land spotted by [[Bjarni HerjÃ³lfsson]] several years earlier. He is believed to have established a colony at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] in [[Newfoundland]], which lasted only a year. Two further attempts at colonization by his brother ended in failure.  The [[Althing|AlÃ¾ingi]] (general assembly) was founded in 930, marking the beginning of the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]]. It was the predecessor to the modern Icelandic legislature. The Althing is the oldest, still-standing, parliament in the world that has written documents to prove its age.   Iceland was a free state, without a king, until the end of the [[SturlungaÃ¶ld]] civil war in 1262, when it joined the Norwegian kingdom as a Norwegian [[colony]].  From 1387 Iceland was in practice ruled by Denmark, following the union of the two kingdoms. When that union was dissolved in 1814, through the [[Treaty of Kiel]], which saw Norway entering a union with Sweden, Iceland became a Danish colony. Home rule was granted by the Danish government in 1904, and independence followed in 1918. From 1918 Iceland was in a [[personal union]] with Denmark, with foreign relations being carried out by the Danes, as instructed by the Icelandic government until the [[World War II]] military occupation of Denmark by Germany in 1940. Subsequently, Iceland was occupied by the [[Aly,a i oh1 apgotTsatecesu;e<ipi

Generated seq by model:- or horrify the reader. Historically, the cause of the &quot;horror&quot; experience has often been the intrusion of an evil, or occasionally misunderstood, [[supernatural]] element into everyday human experience.  Since the 1960s, any work of fiction with a morbid, gruesome, [[Surrealism|surreal]], exceptionally [[suspense]]ful or frightening theme has come to be called &quot;horror.&quot;  Horror fiction often overlaps with [[science fiction]] and/or [[fantasy]], all of which have sometimes been placed under the umbrella category [[speculative fiction]]. See also [[supernatural fiction]].  == Early horror fiction ==  [[Fictional character]]s have found themselves in horrifying situations from the earliest recorded tales. Many [[Mythology|myth]]s and [[legend]]s feature scenarios and [[archetypes]] used by later horror writers. Tales collected by the [[Grimm Brothers]] are often quite horrific.  Modern horror fiction found its roots in the [[gothic novel]]s that exploded into popularity in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, typified by [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''The Mysteries of Udolpho'' and [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''The Castle of Otranto''.  A variation on the Gothic formula that remains one of the most enduring and imitated horror works is [[Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818, revised version 1831). ''Frankenstein'' has also been considered [[science fiction]] or a [[philosophy|philosophical]] novel by some literary historians.  At the same time, [[John William Polidori]] devised the kind of [[vampire]] story that has since become familiar with his novella ''[[The Vampyre]]''. This kind of supernatural character, combining evil with sinister charm, has since been much used and elaborated by horror writers.  Later gothic horror descendants included seminal late 19th century works such as [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' and [[Henry James]]'s ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''. Early horror works used mood and subtlety to deliver an eerie and otherworldly flavor, but usually eschewed extensive explicit violence.  Other early exponents of the horror form number such luminaries as [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[H. P. Lovecraft]] who are widely considered to be masters of the art. Among the writers of classic English [[ghost]] stories, [[M.R. James]] is often cited as the finest. His stories avoid shock effects and often involve an [[Oxford]] [[antiquarian]] as their hero. [[Algernon Blackwood]]'s ''The Willows'' and [[Oliver Onions]]'s ''The Beckoning Fair One'' have been called the best ghost stories. Lovecraft and [[Sheridan le Fanu]] called some of their writing '''weird fiction''' or '''weird stories'''.  Some stories  in highbrow &quot;literary&quot; fiction could arguably be regarded as horror narratives: examples include [[Franz Kafka]]'s &quot;[[The Metamorphosis]]&quot; (''Die Verwandlung'') and &quot;[[In the Penal Colony]]&quot; (''In der Strafkolonie'') and [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[A Rose for Emily]]''.  == Contemporary horror fiction ==  Some modern practitioners of the genre have resorhhut 'heeoeiueo.iaoh hh itit

Generated seq by model:- m'' and ''Hesychast'' refer to the practice and to the practitioners of a method of mental ascesis that involves the use of the Jesus Prayer assisted by certain psychophysical techniques.  Most likely, the rise of term ''Hesychasm'' reflects the coming to the fore of this practice as something concrete that can be discussed.  Books used by the Hesychast include the ''[[Philokalia]],'' a collection of texts on prayer and solitary mental ascesis written from the 4th to the 15th Centuries, this collection existing in a number of independent redactions; the ''Ladder of Divine Ascent;'' the collected works of [[St Symeon the New Theologian]] (949â1022); and the works of [[St Isaac the Syrian]] (7th C.?â8th C.?), as they were selected and translated into Greek at the [[Monastery of St Savas]] in [[Jerusalem]] about the 10th Century.  ==Hesychastic practice==  Hesychastic practice bears some superficial resemblance to mystical prayer or meditation in Eastern religions ([[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Sufism]], compare with [[yoga]]), although this similarity is often over-emphasized in popular accounts and is generally rejected by actual Orthodox practitioners of Hesychasm.  The practice may involve specific body postures, and be accompanied by very deliberate breathing patterns.  However, these bodily postures and breathing patterns are treated as secondary by both modern Athonite practitioners of Hesychasm (e.g. ''Elder Ephraim of Katounakia,'' p. 114 (Greek edition)) and by the more ancient texts in the ''Philokalia'' (e.g. ''On the Two Methods of Prayer'' by St Gregory of Sinai), the emphasis being on the primary role of Grace.  Hesychasts are fully inseted into the Liturgical and [[Sacraments|sacramental]] life of the Orthodox Church, including the daily cycle of prayer of the [[Canonical hours|Divine Office]] and the [[Divine Liturgy]].  However, Hesychasts who are living as hermits may have a very rare attendance at the Divine Liturgy (see the life of St Seraphim of Sarov) and may not recite the Divine Office except by means of the Jesus Prayer (attested practice on Mt Athos).  In general, the Hesychast seeks to restrict his external activities for the sake of his Hesychastic practice.  Hesychastic practice involves acquiring an inner stillness and ignoring the physical senses.  In this, Hesychasm shows its roots in Evagrius Pontikos and even in the Greek tradition of asceticism that goes back to [[Plato]].  The Hesychast interprets Christ's injunction in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] to &quot;go into your closet to pray&quot;, to mean that he should ignore the senses and withdraw inward.  St John of Sinai writes:  &quot;Hesychasm is the enclosing of the bodiless mind ''(nous)'' in the bodily house of the body.&quot;  ''(Ladder,'' Step 27, 5, (Step 27, 6 in the Holy Transfiguration edition).)  In Step 27, 21 of the ''Ladder'' (Step 27, 22â3 of the Holy Transfiguration edition), St John of Sinai describes Hesychast practice as follows:  ::Take up your seat on a high place and watch, if only you know how, and then y to=uti ear eyu ]'c' eiiam hio

In cases of leakage of nuclear materials without fission, or a [[dirty bomb]], this precaution would be of no avail. KI might also serve to dilute the radioactive [[caesium-137]] produced by nuclear fission, because caesium is chemically related to potassium, but potassium chloride would serve as well. The latter is available in low-sodium table salt. The use of KI or NaI to dilute radioactive caesium is problematic, however, because the latter has a half-life of thirty years, requiring long-term dietary change if it is to be diluted with non-radioactive potassium. *[[Tungsten]] iodide is used to stabilize the filaments in [[light bulb]]s. *[[Nitrogen triiodide]] is an explosive, too unstable to be used commercially, but is commonly used in college [[prank]]s. *[[Iodine-131]] is used as a tracer in medicine.  == History == Iodine ([[Greek language|Gr.]] ''iodes'' meaning violet) was discovered by [[Barnard Courtois]] in [[1811]].  He was the son of a manufacturer of [[saltpeter]] (potassium nitrate, a vital part of gunpowder). At the time [[France]] was at war and gunpowder was in great demand. Saltpeter was isolated from seaweed washed up on the coasts of [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]]. To isolate the potassium nitrate, seaweed was burned and the ash then washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding [[sulfuric acid]]. One day Courtois added too much sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapor rose. Courtois noted that the vapor crystallized on cold surfaces making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this was a new element but lacked the money to pursue his observations.  However he gave samples to his friends, [[Charles Bernard Desormes]] ([[1777]]&amp;ndash;[[1862]]) and [[Nicolas ClÃ©ment]] ([[1779]]-&amp;ndash;[[1841]]) to continue research. He also gave some of the substance to [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] ([[1778]]&amp;ndash;[[1850]]), a well-known chemist at that time, and to [[AndrÃ©-Marie AmpÃ¨re]] ([[1775]]&amp;ndash;[[1836]]). On [[November 29]] [[1813]] Dersormes and ClÃ©ment made public Courtois&amp;rsquo; discovery. They described the substance to a meeting of the Imperial Institute of France. On [[December 6]] Gay-Lussac announced that the new substance was either an element or a compound of oxygen. AmpÃ¨re had given some of his sample to [[Humphry Davy]] (1778&amp;ndash;[[1829]]). Davy did some experiments on the substance and noted its similarity to chlorine. Davy sent a letter dated [[December 10]] to the [[Royal Society of London]] stating that he had identified a new element. A large argument erupted between Davy and Gay-Lussac over who identified iodine first but both scientists acknowledged Bernard Courtois as the first to isolate the [[chemical element]].  == Occurrence == Iodine can be prepared in an ultrapure form through the reaction of [[potassium iodide]] with [[copper (II) sulfate]].

Heckler &amp; Koch are famous for the precision, durability, reliability and accuracy of their firearms. All firearms made by H&amp;K are named by the prefix HK and the official designation.  Heckler &amp; Koch has a history of innovations in small arms, such as the use of [[polymer]]s. Not all of its technologically ambitious designs have resulted in successful products (for instance, the advanced but now abandoned [[Heckler &amp; Koch G11|G11]] [[assault rifle]]). HK produces the whole range of [[small arms]], from [[pistol]]s to [[Hand grenade|grenade]], and [[machine gun]]s. In its extensive product range, HK has used most of the operating systems for small arms: [[Blowback (arms)|blowback]], [[short-recoil]], [[roller-delayed blowback]], [[gas-delayed blowback]], and [[gas-operated]].    HK was founded by Edmund Heckler, Theodor Koch, and Alex Seidel in [[1949]] from the remnants of [[Mauser]], and the company was registered in [[1950]]. In the beginning, the company produced [[sewing machine]]s and other fine mechanics, but this was changed in [[1956]] when the company constructed a [[rifle]] for the German [[Bundeswehr]]. In [[1991]], H&amp;K was bought by [[British Aerospace]]/[[Royal Ordnance]] (now [[BAE Systems]]) who resold it to a German group that was created for this purpose in [[2002]].  The company is located in [[Oberndorf am Neckar|Oberndorf]] in the [[States of Germany|Bundesland]] of [[Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg]], but also has a subsidiary in the [[United States]]. Their slogan is: &quot;In a world of compromise, some don't!&quot; (There is some confusion about the pronunciation of the word &quot;Koch&quot;. Some non-German speakers incorrectly say &quot;Kotch&quot; or &quot;Coke&quot;, but it rhymes with [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/loch loch].)

In the big cities and towns of India, buses are the major mode of transport. Luxury and air-conditioned buses also service some cities. Most means of transportation within cities is run by the government. Buses are categorised, based upon the number of seats, the time it takes to travel from A to B, and general comfort. Express and limited buses are usually more expensive options compared to the normal ones, the latter being increasingly modern whilst cheap and easily accessible. {{seealso|Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport|Delhi Transport Corporation}}  ===Vans=== Vans or Mini-Buses is a more prevalent form of transportation especially in remote areas and common route with consistent yet small transportation needs. Not to mention it's presence in other cities,where it is often a traffice menace.  ===Autorickshaws=== [[Image:Autorickshaw.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|An Auto-rickshaws in [[Delhi]].]] {{main|Autorickshaw}}  An auto rickshaw (auto or rickshaw or tempo in popular parlance) is a three-wheeler [[vehicle for hire]]. They typically have no doors or seatbelts. They are generally yellow or green in colour and have a black canopy on the top. An auto rickshaw is generally characterized by a tin/iron body resting on three small wheels (one in front, two on the rear), a small cabin for the driver in the front and seating for three in the rear. Their design varies considerably from place to place. In some locations, they have an extra plank on the seat to accommodate a fourth passenger. Hiring an auto often involves bargaining with the driver.   In some cities like New Delhi, there are larger autos called Fat-fat,which is an onomatopoeic derivation of the phut-phut crackle of their exhausts. These run on fixed routes on fixed fares and are very fuel efficient. Only six passengers are allowed legally but they usually take as many as ten adults. These autos are the new incarnation of old Fat-fats, which were Harley-Davidson and similar powerful motorcycles modified by removing the rear wheel and bolting a two-wheeled platform with bench seats onto the rear.  ===Two-wheelers=== Two wheelers are the most popular mode of transport in terms of number of vehicles. There are two main types of powered two-wheelers, the [[motor scooter]] and the [[motorcycle]].  The scooter was first built in post-war Italy as a two-wheeler with small wheels (supposedly to utilize war-surplus aircraft tailwheels). It differs from the motorcycle in having the driver seated with his legs together, and is thus favoured by women drivers (as [[sari]], a common Indian dress for women, doesn't permit separation of legs). The Italian Vespa scooter was built in India under licence by Bajaj Auto, and tog Cq2r0 i  yrhi=gi[ilg te s a=-

This gives the island a [[population density]] of 345 people per square mile, or 133 per square kilometer.  ==Culture== The culture of the Isle of Man is strongly influenced by its [[Celt]]ic and [[Norse]] origins. It is currently enjoying a revival of the [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] [[Manx language]] (''Gaelg''). Although the last original native speaker died in 1974, small children are once again being brought up speaking Manx. There are now 27 known native speakers and 650 other speakers. Manx is closely related to the [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Irish language]]s. A well known Manx expression is &quot;Traa Dy Liooar&quot;, meaning &quot;time enough&quot; and represents a stereotypical view of the Manx attitude to life. {{See|music of the Isle of Man}}  ==Government== {{Main|Politics of the Isle of Man}}  ===Structure=== The Isle of Man is a self-governing [[crown dependency]]. The [[head of state]] is the [[Lord of Mann]] who is the British Sovereign, currently [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty The Queen]], her title on the Island is [[Lord of Mann]]. She is represented by the Island's [[Lieutenant Governor]]. The [[United Kingdom]] is responsible for the Island's defence and for representing the Island in international forums, while the Island's own [[parliament]] has competence over almost all domestic matters.  The Island's parliament is ''[[Tynwald]]'' (''Tinvaal'') , which dates from 979 A.D. Tynwald is a tricameral legislature, comprising the [[House of Keys]] (directly elected by universal suffrage) and the [[Legislative Council (Isle of Man)|Legislative Council]] (consisting of indirectly elected and ex officio members). Furthermore, when these two bodies meet together the third chamber, called Tynwald, is formed. There is a Council of Ministers, which is headed by the Chief Minister, currently [[Donald Gelling]].  As of 2005, the Island's system of government is under review &amp;mdash; there are plans to transform the Legislative Council into a directly-elected chamber, echoing the push for reform in the UK's [[House of Lords]] and the abolition of indirectly elected Conseillers in [[Guernsey]]. To date, no legislation has successfully passed through the House of Keys and given the fact that the issue has been high up the political agenda for over a decade, change does not seem to be forthcoming in the short term. This was reinforced by the political retirement of one of the main proposers of change, Edgar Quine. In October 2005 Tynwald accepted a proposal to change the title of the [[Lieutenant Governor]] to [[Crown Commissioner]] or [[Barrantagh y Chrooin]] in Manx (the title would also be &quot;Barrantagh ny Benrein,&quot; or &quot;Queen's Commissioner&quot;; when there is a King it will be &quot;Bar ra  es -.qhgitiehC a[,q  i|A

He was a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]], the third President of the Second Continental Congress ([[November 1]], [[1777]] - [[December 9]], [[1778]]), the Vice-President of South Carolina, and a diplomat.  ==Personal life== Henry was born to John and Esther Grasset Laurens on [[March 6]], 1724 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. His father was a saddler and his parents had come to  Charles Town as part of the [[Huguenot]] immigration, drawn by the promise of religious liberty. His family prospered, and in [[1744]] Henry went to [[England]] where he learned the ways of commerce from a merchant who had formerly lived in Charleston.  Henry returned to Charleston in 1747. He entered the export and import business and became a prosperous merchant. On [[June 25]], [[1750]] he married Eleanor Ball. The couple would have twelve children. While seven died in infancy or childhood, others achieved prominence. Their son [[John Laurens]] fought and died in the Revolution. Their daughter Mary married [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]], while their son Henry married Eliza, the daughter of [[John Rutledge]].  In 1772, Henry, like many successful American merchants began to buy farmland. He purchased 3,000 acres (12 km&amp;sup2;) at [[Mepkin Abbey|Mepkin]]. Although he later bought another 20,000 acres (81 km&amp;sup2;), Mepkin became the family seat. By 1776 he had given up his mercantile ventures, although he always ran his plantations in a very business-like way.  ==Political career== [[Image:Washington Gates Franklin Laurens Jones 1784.jpg|thumb|left|1.

Colonel in campaigns against the [[Cherokee]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in 1757-1761.  [[1757]] also marked the first year he was elected to the colonial assembly. He was elected again every year but one until the revolution replaced the assembly with a state Convention as an interim government.  The year he missed was [[1773]] when he visited England to arrange for his children's education.  He was named to the colony's Council in 1764 and 1768, but declined both times.  In [[1772]] he joined the [[American Philosophical Society]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], and carried on some extensive correspondence with other members.  As the [[American Revolution]] neared, Laurens first inclination was to support reconciliation with the [[United Kingdom|British Crown]].  But as conditions deteriorated he came to fully support the American position.  When Carolina began the creation of a revolutionary government, he was elected to the Provincial Congress which first met on [[January 9]], [[1775]].

He was known for his flamboyant writing style, most notably in his novel ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', which blurred the distinctions between writer and subject, fiction and nonfiction. He was the creator of [[gonzo journalism]] and, as such, is widely imitated.  ==Early years== A [[Louisville, Kentucky]] native, Thompson grew up in the [[Cherokee Triangle]] neighborhood of the [[Highlands]] and attended [[Louisville Male High School]]. His parents, Jack (d. [[1952]]) and Virginia (d. [[1999]]), married in [[1935]]. Jack's death left three sons&amp;mdash;Hunter, Davison, and James&amp;mdash;to be brought up by their mother, who was a heavy drinker.{{fn|1}} Thompson's difficult youth, and its influence on his behavior and the development of his misanthropic [[worldview]], awaits serious literary analysis.  After early trouble with the law, including an arrest in [[1956]] for robbery, he enlisted in the [[Air Force]] as part of his sentence. At [[Eglin Air Force Base]], [[Florida]], in [[1956]], he began working as a [[sports]] journalist, writing for the base [[newspaper]] and moonlighting for various local newspapers on the side, despite regulations.  He was discharged in [[1958]] and claimed to have been issued a &quot;totally unclassifiable&quot; status. On the [[GI Bill]] Thompson attended the [[Columbia University]]'s School of General Studies where he took classes on short story writing, while maintaining a [[Beat generation|beat]]-inspired lifestyle in [[New York City]].   During this time he also worked briefly for [[Time Magazine]] as a copyboy for $50 a week. While at Time he also copied two novels in their entirety on a typewriter in order to learn about the writing styles of the authors. They were [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' and [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[A Farewell To Arms]]''. He was fired from the job at Time in early [Ce'oia9  o|sq|;[dg.o  g Aag. u

From [[1 January]] [[1801]] until [[6 December]] [[1922]], Ireland was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. During the [[Irish Potato Famine|Great Potato Famine]] in 1845-1849 the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30%. 1 million Irish died of starvation, another 1.5 million were forced to emigrate, which set the emigration pattern for the century to come and would result in a constant decline up to the 1960s. From [[1874]], but particularly from [[1880]] under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] moved to prominence with its attempts to achieve [[Home Rule]], which would have given Ireland some autonomy without requiring it to leave the United Kingdom. It seemed possible in [[1911]] when the [[House of Lords]] lost their veto, and [[John Redmond]] secured the Third [[Home Rule Act 1914]]. The [[unionist]] movement, however, had been growing since [[1886]] among Irish [[Protestant]]s, fearing that they would face discrimination, and lose economic and social privileges if Irish [[Catholics]] were to achieve real political power. Though Irish unionism existed throughout the whole of Ireland, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century unionism was particularly strong in parts of [[Ulster]], where industrialisation was more common in contrast to the more agrarian rest of the island. (Any tariff barriers would, it was feared, most heavily hit that region.) In addition, the Protestant population was more strongly located in Ulster, with unionist majorities existing in about four counties. Under the leadership of the [[Dublin]]-born [[Edward Carson|Sir Edward Carson]] and the northerner [[James Craig|Sir James Craig]] they became more militant. In [[1914]], to avoid rebellion in Ulster, the British [[Prime Minister]] [[Herbert Asquith]], with agreement of the leadership of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] leadership, inserted a clause into the bill providing for home rule for 26 of the 32 counties, with an as of yet undecided new set of measures to be introduced for the area temporarily excluded. Though it received the [[Royal Assent]], the Third [[Home Rule Act 1914]]'s implementation was suspended until after the [[World War I|Great War]]. (The war at that stage was expected to be ended by 1915, not the four years it did ultimately last.) For the prior reasons Redmond and his Irish [[National Volunteers]] supported the Allied cause, and tens of thousands joined the British Army.  In January [[1919]], after the December 1918 [[Irish (UK) general election, 1918|general elections]], 73 of Ireland's 106 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] elected were [[Sinn Fein]] members who refused to take their seats in the [[British House of Commons]].

Originally, in the 15th century or earlier, the term meant &quot;[[indivisible]]&quot; as still used in statistics (see below), but from the seventeenth century on the term indicated separateness, as in [[individualism]]. (Abbs 1986, cited in Klein 2005, p.26-27)  In [[metaphysics]] and [[statistics]], the word '''individual''', while sometimes meaning &quot;a person&quot;, more typically describes any numerically singular thing.  Used in many contexts, both 'Socrates' and 'the Moon' denote individuals; 'grapefruit' and 'redness' (generally) do not. 'Individual' as a piece of philosophical jargon is much-bandied and often to be found in the company of ''[[particular]]'' -- indeed, often treated as ''synonymous with'' 'particular' (though one wonders if abstract particulars can count as individuals) -- and contrasted with '[[universal]]'.  == References == * Gracia, Jorge J.

For more discussion on definitions, see below.  == Etymology == The contemporary use of the term first appeared on [[Usenet]] groups in the late [[1980s]]. It is widely thought to be a contraction of the phrase &quot;trolling for suckers&quot;, itself derived from the [[sport fishing]] technique of [[trolling for fish|trolling]]. The latter can be compared with [[trawling]], of which it is a near [[homophone]].  The word likely gained currency because of its apt second meaning, drawn from the &quot;[[troll]]s&quot;, which are portrayed in [[Scandinavia]]n [[folklore]], and children's tales, as often ugly, obnoxious creatures that are bent on [[wickedness]] and mischief.

The average elevation is around 1,000&amp;nbsp;m with the higher peaks occurring in the northern section of the range in Maharashtra. Two of the notable peaks lying in the western ghats are [[Kalsubai]] 1,646&amp;nbsp;m (5,427&amp;nbsp;feet) and [[Mahabaleshwar]] 1,438&amp;nbsp;m (4,710&amp;nbsp;feet).  The '''[[Eastern Ghats]]''' are a discontinuous range of mountains, which have been eroded and cut through by the four major rivers of southern [[India]], the [[Godavari]], [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], and [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]]. These mountain ranges extend from [[West Bengal]] in the north, through [[Orissa]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]] to [[Tamil Nadu]] in the south. They run parallel to the [[Bay of Bengal]] and are not as tall as the Western Ghats, though some of its peaks are over 1000&amp;nbsp;m in height.  The Eastern and Western Ghats meet at the [[Nilgiri]] knot in Tamil Nadu. The [[Anai Mudi]] in the [[Cardamom Hills]] at 2,695&amp;nbsp;m (8,841&amp;nbsp;feet) in Kerala is the highest peak in the Western Ghats. The Nilgiris are considered to be a part of the Western Ghats.  ===Indo-Gangetic plain=== {{main|Indo-Gangetic plain}} [[Image:Ganga.jpg|thumb|200px|A satellite view of the Gangetic plains.]] [[Image:IndoGangeticPlain Map.png|thumb|240px|Extent of the Indo-Gangetic plain across South Asia.]] The '''Indo-Gangetic plains''' are large [[floodplain]]s of the [[Indus]] and the [[Ganga]]-[[Brahmaputra]] river systems. They run parallel to the Himalaya mountains, from [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in the west to [[Assam]] in the east, draining the states of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Haryana]], eastern [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]] and [[West Bengal]]. The plains encompass an area of 700,000&amp;nbsp;km&amp;sup2; (270,000&amp;nbsp;mile&amp;sup2;) and vary in width through their length by several hundred kilometres. Major rivers that form a part of this system are the Ganga ([[Ganges River|Ganges]]) and [[Indus River]] along with their tributaries; [[Beas River|Beas]], [[Yamuna River|Yamuna]], [[Gomti River|Gomti]], [[Ravi River|Ravi]], [[Chambal River|Chambal]], [[Sutlej River|Sutlej]] and [[Chenab River|Chenab]].  The Indo-Gangetic belt is the world's most extensive expanse of uninterrupted [[alluvium]] formed by the deposition of [[silt]] by the numerous rivers. The plains are flat and mostly treeless, making it conducive for [[irrigation]] through [[canal]]s. The area is also rich in [[ground water]] sources.  The plains are one of the world's most [[intensive farming|intensely farmed]] areas. Crops grown on the Indo-Gangetic Plain are primarily [[rice]] and [[wheat]], grown in [[Crop rotation|rotation]]. Other crops include [[maize]], [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]].

For example, teaching of anatomy was a part of the teaching of surgery, [[embryology]] was a part of training in pediatrics and [[obstetrics]], and the knowledge of [[physiology]] and [[pathology]] was interwoven in the teaching of all the clinical disciplines.  At the closing of the initiation, the [[guru]] gave a solemn address to the students where the guru directed the students to a life of chastity, honesty, and [[vegetarianism]]. The student was to strive with all his being for the health of the sick. He was not to betray patients for his own advantage. He was to dress modestly and avoid strong drink. He was to be collected and self-controlled, measured in speech at all times. He was to constantly improve his knowledge and technical skill. In the home of the patient he was to be courteous and modest, directing all attention to the patient's welfare. He was not to divulge any knowledge about the patient and his family. If the patient was incurable, he was to keep this to himself if it was likely to harm the patient or others.  The normal length of the student's training appears to have been seven years. Before graduation, the student was to pass a test. But the physician was to continue to learn through texts, direct observation ([[pratyaksha]]), and through inference ([[anumÄna]]). In addition, the [[vaidyas]] attended meetings where knowledge was exchanged. The doctors were also enjoined to gain knowledge of unusual remedies from hillsmen, herdsmen, and forest-dwellers. Ancient Indian cultures also cultivated systems of healing such as [[Pranic healing]].  In [[2001]], archaeologists studying the remains of two men from [[Mehrgarh]], [[Pakistan]], made the discovery that the people of [[Indus Valley Civilization]], even from the early [[Harappa]]n periods (circa [[3300 BC]]), had knowledge of medicine and [[dentistry]]. The physical anthropologist who carried out the examinations, Professor Andrea Cucina from the University of Missouri-Columbia, made the discovery when he was cleaning the teeth from one of the men. (See [[Indus Valley Civilization#Science|Indus Valley Civilization: Science]])  ===Chinese medicine=== ''See main article: [[History of traditional Chinese medicine]].''  China also developed a large body of traditional medicine. Much of the philosophy of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] derived from empirical observations of disease and illness by [[Taoist]] physicians and reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. These causative principles, whether material, essential, or metaphysical, correlate as the expression of the natural order of the universe.    During the golden age of his reign from 2696 to 2598 B.C, as a result of a dialogue with his minister Ch'i Pai, the [[Yellow Emperor]] is supposed by Chinese tradition to have composed his ''Neijing (å§ç¶) [[Suwen]] (ç´ å)'' or ft.fnl ir=ioroi]feT' q   E=0fg

Generated seq by model:- n of the impetus toward an iconoclastic movement in Eastern Orthodoxy to Muslims or Jews &quot;''seems to have been highly exaggerated, both by contemporaries and by modern scholars''&quot; (see Pelikan, ''The Spirit of Eastern Christendom'').  Though significant in the history of religious doctrine, the Byzantine controversy over images is not seen as of primary importance in Byzantine history.  &quot;Few historians still hold it to have been the greatest issue of the period...&quot; (Patricia Karlin-Hayter, Oxford History of Byzantium, Oxford University Press, 2002).  The Iconoclastic Period began when images were banned by Emperor [[Leo III]] sometime between 726 and 730. Under his son [[Constantine V]], an ecumenical council forbidding image veneration was held at Hieria near Constantinople in 754.  Image veneration was later reinstated by the [[Irene (empress)|Empress Regent Irene]], under whom another ecumenical council was held reversing the decisions of the previous iconoclast council and taking its title as [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]].  The council anathemized all who hold to iconoclasm, i.e. those who held that veneration of images constitutes idolatry. Then the ban was enforced again by [[Leo V]] in 815. And finally icon veneration was decisively restored by [[Theodora (9th century)|Empress Regent Theodora]].   [[Image:vladimirskaya.jpg|right|thumb|The &quot;[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]&quot; icon (12th century)]]  ==Icons in Greek-speaking regions== Icons are used particularly among [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic]] and [[Eastern Rites|Eastern-rite Catholic]] populations.  As was described above, the icon painting tradition developed in Byzantium, with Constantinople as the chief city. We have only a few icons from the 11th century and no icons dating from the two centuries that preceded it, firstly because of the Iconoclastic reforms during which many were destroyed, secondly because of plundering by Venetians in 1204 during the [[Crusades]], and finally the taking of the city by the Islamic Turks in 1453.   It was only in the [[Comnenus|Comnenian]] period (1081-1185) that the cult of the icon became widespread in the Byzantine world, partly on account of the dearth of richer materials (such as [[mosaic]]s, [[ivory]], and [[enamel]]s), but also because a [[iconostasis|special screen for icons]] was introduced in eccelsiastical practice. The style of the time was severe, hieratic and distant.    In the late Comnenian period this severity softened, and emotion, formerly avoided, entered icon painting. Major monuments for this change include the murals at [[Daphni]] (ca. 1100) and [[Nerezi]] near [[Skopje]] (1164). The [[Theotokos of Vladimir]] (ca. 1115, illustrated to the right) is probably the most representative monument to the new trend towards spirituality and emotion.  The tendency toward emotionalism in icons continued in the [[Paleologus|Paleologan Period]], which began in 1261.  Paleologan art reached its pinnacle in momy;p h|o.guh]n''q* ia n 'eR=l0

Generated seq by model:- n will be enclosed in [[vertical bar|pipes]] (&quot;| |&quot;). This goes beyond phonology into [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] analysis. For example, the words ''pets'' and ''beds'' could be transcribed phonetically as {{IPA|[pÊ°ÉÊts]}} and {{IPA|[bÌ¥Édz]}} (in a fairly narrow transcription), and phonemically as {{IPA|/pets/}} and {{IPA|/bedz/}}. Because /s/ and /z/ are separate [[phoneme]]s in English (unlike Spanish, for example), they receive separate symbols in the phonemic analysis. However, you probably recognize that underneath this, they represent the same plural ending. This can be indicated with the pipe notation. If you believe the plural ending is essentially an ''s'', as English spelling would suggest, the words can be transcribed {{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;|pets|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} and {{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;|beds|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}. If, as most linguists would probably suggest, it is essentially a ''z'', these would be {{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;|petz|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} and {{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;|bedz|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}.  To avoid confusion with IPA symbols, it may be desirable to specify when native orthography is being used, so that, for example, the English word ''jet'' is not read as &quot;yet&quot;. This is done with [[Bracket|angle brackets]] or ''chevrons'': {{Unicode|ãjetã}}. It is also common to italicize such words, but the chevrons indicate specifically that they are in the original language's orthography, and not in English [[transliteration]].  The Extended IPA for [[speech pathology]] has added additional bracket notations. Parentheses are used to indicate ''mouthing'' (silent articulation), as in {{IPA|(ÊËË)}}, a silent sign to hush; parentheses are also used to indicate silent pauses, for example (...). Double parentheses indicate obscured or unintelligible sound, as in ((2 syll.)), two audible but unidentifiable syllables. Curly brackets with Italian musical terms are used to mark prosodic notation, such as {{IPA|[{&lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;''falsetto''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; hÉlp &lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;''falsetto''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}]}}.  == Consonants (pulmonic) == ===Single articulation=== [[Media:IPA consonants 2005.png|Closeup of the main pulmonic consonant section of the IPA chart]]  The [[pulmonic egressive|pulmonic]] consonant table, which includes most consonants, is arranged in rows that designate [[manner of articulation]] and columns that designate [[place of articulation]].

Generated seq by model:-  [[China]] and other [[developing nation]]s. The United States and the United Kingdom are the only two nations who consistently receive net balance of payment benefits from intellectual property, and are amongst the chief supporters of intellectual property systems.  A more recent notion, proposing to expand the scope of exclusive rights to include databases, has been introduced by the EU in 1996. This is the idea of protecting the information contained in a database against re-utilisation and extraction of substantial parts. This would be an additional right predicated on a substantial investment, that would exist alongside the copyright in the database structure. This notion was opposed by the United States Supreme Court in 1991 in the Feist Publication finding, which said that exclusive rights cannot cover the factual elements of any copyrighted work, that copyright does not derive from the effort expended in the production of the work, and that in the case of a collection of information, only the originality that may be found in the selection and arrangement of the information is governed by copyright. This case holds that the purpose of exclusive rights policy is to provide information to the public, and this consideration takes priority over concerns such as investment. A study has found that the introduction of exclusive rights to databases in the EU did not do any good to the economy.  The direct incentive beneficiaries of exclusive rights have an interest in expanding their rights and benefits. Many pool their resources to form organizations that attempt this such as the Business Software Alliance (BSA), which purports to represent the interests of the commercial software industry while the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) represents the interests of the commercial music publishing industry. As policy expands in accordance with the notion of &quot;intellectual property&quot;, in the interests of those who benefit directly from its economic incentives, it tends to reduce the rights of its primary beneficiaries, the general public.  Under the notion of &quot;intellectual property&quot; the public is increasingly prevented by law from benefiting from the use of published information without complying with the conditions set by the rightsholder. The cost for this to the public is not easy to quantify. The cost is distributed widely and unequally based on the need for the product. Ironically the direct incentive beneficiary organizations are a good source for these data. The BSA reports a study that claims &quot;while $80 billion in software was installed on computers worldwide last year, only $51 billion was legally purchased&quot; (Source:[http://www.bsa.org/globalstudy/ BSA]). The BSA says &quot;software pirates&quot; avoided a cost of $29 billion while the rest that obey the policy and do not purchase or make use of the work bear a real and substantial [[opportunity cost]] that is yet uncounted. However, it is questionable whether Microsoft would lower their price if it would earn $10 billion Imu'2ouhuq i elqhTqa1;e|y]qgl

Magnitogorsk was at the forefront of Stalin's Five-Year Plans in the 1930s.]]  The years from [[1929]] to [[1939]] comprised a tumultuous decade in Russian historyâa period of massive industrialization and internal struggles as [[Joseph Stalin]] established near total control over Russian society, wielding unrestrained power unknown to even the most ambitious tsars. Following Lenin's death Stalin wrestled to gain control of the Soviet Union with rival factions in the Politburo, especially [[Leon Trotsky]]'s. By [[1928]], with the [[Trotskyist]]s either exiled or rendered powerless, Stalin was ready to put a radical program of industrialization into action.  In 1928 Stalin proposed the first [[Five-Year Plan]]. Abolishing the NEP, it was the first of a number of plans aimed at swift accumulation of capital resources though the buildup of heavy industry, the [[Collectivisation in the USSR|collectivization of agriculture]], and the restricted manufacture of [[consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]] and for the first time in history a government controlled all economic activity. While in the capitalist countries factories and mines were idle or running on reduced schedules during the [[Great Depression]] and millions were unemployed, the Soviet people worked many hours a day, six days a week, in a thoroughgoing attempt to revolutionize the Soviet economic structure.  As a part of the plan, the government took control of agriculture through the state and collective farms (''see'' [[collectivisation in the USSR|collectivization in the USSR]]). By a decree of February [[1930]], about one million [[Kulak|&quot;kulaks&quot;]] were forced off their land. Many peasants strongly opposed regimentation by the state, often slaughtering their herds when faced with the loss of their land. In some sections they revolted, and countless peasants deemed &quot;kulaks&quot; by the authorities were executed. The combination of bad weather, deficiencies of the hastily-established collective farms, and massive confiscation of grain precipitated a serious famine, and several million peasants died of starvation, mostly in Ukraine and parts of southwestern Russia. The deteriorating conditions in the countryside drove millions of desperate peasants to the rapidly growing cities, fuelling industrialization, and vastly increasing Russia's urban population in the space of just a few years.  The plans received remarkable results in areas aside from agriculture. Russia, in many measures the poorest nation in Europe at the time of the Bolshevik Revolution, now industrialized at a phenomenal rate, far surpassing Germany's pace of industrialization in the nineteenth century and Japan's earlier in the twentieth century. Soviet authorities claimed in [[1932]] an increase of industrial output of 334 percent over [[1914]], and in [[192lla la  qq ]    | e ]q;qii  ;

They comprised the essential force of Hussism. Their aim was to destroy the enemies of the law of God, and to extend his kingdom by the sword. For the latter purpose they waged bloody wars, for the former purpose they established a strict jurisdiction, inflicting the severest punishment not only upon heinous crimes like murder and adultery, but also upon faults like perjury and [[usury]], and tried to apply the conditions required in the law of God to the social relations of the world.  == The [[Hussite Wars]]== The news of the death of King Wenceslaus  produced the greatest commotion among the people of Prague. A revolution swept over the country; churches and monasteries were destroyed, and the ecclesiastical possessions were seized by the Hussite nobility. Sigismund could get  possession of his kingdom only by force of arms. Pope Martin V called upon all Christians of the Occident to take up arms against the Hussites, and there followed twelve years of [[Hussite Wars | warfare]]. The Hussites initially campaigned defensively, but after 1427 they assumed the offensive. Apart from their religious aims, they fought for the national interests of the Czechs. The moderate and radical parties were united and they not only repelled the attacks of the army of [[crusade]]rs, but entered the neighboring countries.  In 1430, [[Joan of Arc]] dictated a [http://archive.joan-of-arc.org/joanofarc_letter_march_23_1430.html  letter on [[March 23]]] that threatened to lead a crusading army against the Hussites unless they returned to the Catholic Faith; but her capture by English and Burgundian troops two months later would keep her from carrying out this threat.  ==The Council of Basel and Compacta of Prague== Eventually the opponents of the Hussites found themselves forced to consider an amicable settlement. They invited a Bohemian embassy to appear at the [[Council of Basel]]. The discussions began on [[January 10]], [[1432]], centering chiefly in the four articles of [[Prague]]. No agreement emerged. After repeated negotiations between the Basel Council and Bohemia, a Bohemian-Moravian state assembly in Prague accepted the  ''Compacta'' of Prague on [[November 30]], [[1433]].  The agreement granted communion in both kinds to all who desired it, but with the understanding that Christ was entirely present in each kind. Free preaching was granted conditionally: the Church hierarchy had to approve and place priests, and the power of the bishop must be considered. The article which prohibited the secular power of the clergy was almost reversed.   The Taborites refused to conform, and the Calixtines united with the Roman Catholics and destroyed the Taborites in a [[battle of Lipany|battle]] near Lipany ([[May 30]], [[1434]]). From that time the Taborites lost their importance. The state assembly of Jihlava in [[1436]] confirmed the ''Compactata'' and iiy 'Ta-i g} ll9;oqar h.| g]'

Two alternative proposals for introducing a state in an HTTP transactions had been proposed by Brian Behlendorf and David Kristol, respectively, but the group, headed by Kristol himself, soon decided to use the Netscape specification as a starting point. On February 1996, the working group identified third-party cookies as a considerable privacy threat. The specification produced by the group was eventually published as RFC 2109 in February 1997. It specifies that third-party cookies were either not allowed at all, or at least not enabled by default.  At this time, advertising companies were already using third-party cookies. The recommendation about third-party cookies of &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 2109&lt;/nowiki&gt; was not followed by Netscape and Internet Explorer. &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 2109&lt;/nowiki&gt; was followed by RFC 2965 in October 2000.  ==Implementation== ===Setting a cookie=== Transfer of Web pages follows the [[HyperText Transfer Protocol]]. Regardless of cookies, browsers request a page from web servers by sending them a short text called [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP request]]; a request may look like:  {| | |  &lt;div style=&quot;border: solid thin; padding: 0em 1em&quot;&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;GET http://www.w3.org/index.html HTTP/1.1&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Accept: */*&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/code&gt; &lt;/div&gt; | |- | '''browser''' | &lt;center&gt;&amp;rarr;&lt;/center&gt; | '''server''' |}  The server replies by sending the requested page preceded by a similar packet of text, called [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP header]]. This packet may contain lines requesting the browser to store cookies:  {| | | &lt;div style=&quot;border: solid thin; padding: 0em 1em&quot;&gt; &lt;tt&gt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK&lt;br&gt; &lt;font color=green&gt;Set-Cookie: name=value&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; Content-type: text/html&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; (content of page) &lt;/tt&gt; &lt;/div&gt; | |- | '''browser''' | &lt;center&gt;&amp;larr;&lt;/center&gt; | '''server''' |}  The line &lt;code&gt;Set-cookie&lt;/code&gt; is only sent if the server wishes the browser to store a cookie. Indeed, it is a request for the browser to store the string &lt;code&gt;name=value&lt;/code&gt; and send it back in all future requests to the server. If the browser supports cookies and cookies are enabled, every subsequent page request to the same server contains the cookie:  {| | | &lt;div style=&quot;border: solid thin; padding: 0em 1em;&quot;&gt; &lt;tt&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;GET http://www.w3.org/spec.html HTTP/1.1&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;font color=green&gt;Cookie: name=value&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Accept: */*&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/tt&gt; &lt;/div&gt; | |- | '''browser''' | &lt;center&gt;&amp;rarr;&lt;/center&gt; | '''server''' |}  This is a request for another page from the same server, and differs from the first one above because  it contains the string that the server has previously g ioehyoih t o-ro ts= ]h ;aee]

The final act of the passage of power from the Soviet Union to Russia was the passing of the briefcases containing codes that would launch the Soviet nuclear arsenal from Gorbachev to Yeltsin.  ==Russian Federation== ''Main article: [[History of post-Soviet Russia]]'' [[Image:October1993crisis.jpg|framed|left|The shelling of the [[White House of Russia|Russian White House]], October 4, 1993]] By the mid-[[1990s]] Russia had a system of multiparty electoral politics. But it was harder to establish a representative government because of two structural problems&amp;mdash;the struggle between president and parliament and the anarchic party system. Although Yeltsin had won plaudits abroad for casting himself as a democrat to weaken Gorbachev, his conception of the presidency was highly autocratic. He either acted as his own prime minister (until June [[1992]]) or appointed men of his choice, regardless of parliament.  Meanwhile, the profusion of small parties and their aversion to coherent alliances left the legislature chaotic. During [[1993]], Yeltsin's rift with the parliamentary leadership led to the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993|September&amp;ndash;October 1993 constitutional crisis]]. The crisis climaxed on [[October 3]], when Yeltsin chose a radical solution to settle his dispute with parliament: he called up tanks to shell the [[White House of Russia|Russian White House]], blasting out his opponents. As Yeltsin was taking the unconstitutional step of dissolving the legislature, Russia came the closest to serious civil conflict since the revolution of 1917. Yeltsin was then free to impose a constitution with strong presidential powers, which was approved by referendum in December 1993. But the December voting also saw sweeping gains for communists and nationalists, reflecting growing disenchantment with the costs of [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic reforms.  Although Yeltsin came to power on a wave of optimism, he never recovered his popularity after endorsing [[Yegor Gaidar]]'s &quot;[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]&quot; of ending Soviet-era price controls, drastic cuts in state spending, and an open foreign trade regime in early [[1992]] (''see'' [[Economy of Russia#Economic Reform in the 1990s|Russian economic reform in the 1990s]]). The reforms immediately devastated the living standards of much of the population, especially the groups that had enjoyed the benefits of Soviet-era state-controlled wages and prices, state subsidies, and welfare entitlement programs. In the 1990s Russia suffered an economic downturn more severe than the United States or Germany had undergone six decades earlier in the Great Depression.&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|3]]&lt;/sup&gt;  Economic reforms also consolidated a semi-criminal oligarchy with roots in the old Soviet system.

According to its popular modern definition hubris is exaggerated [[pride]] or self-confidence often resulting in fatal retribution.  ==Hubris in ancient times== Hubris is a common theme in [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedies]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], whose stories often featured characters suffering from hubris and subsequently being punished for it. In [[Ancient Greece|Greek law]], it most often refers to violent outrage wreaked by the powerful upon the weak.  There was also a goddess called '''Hubris''' (ââ²Î¥Î²ÏÎ¹Ï), or Hybris, the embodiment of the above concept: insolence and lack of restraint.   The original &quot;hubristic&quot; characters in Greek literature are [[Penelope]]'s suitors in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''. They are eventually made to pay for their presumptuous encroachments on the household of [[Odysseus]].  Hubris has in the past been cited as the &quot;hamÃ¡rtia&quot; (&quot;error&quot;) of characters in Greek tragedy.  The &quot;[[Nemesis (mythology)|nemesis]]&quot; (''nÃ©mesis''), or destruction, which befalls these characters, however, generally comes from the [[Twelve Olympians|gods]], whereas hubris refers for the most part to infractions by mortals against other mortals!  ==Hubris in modern times== Modern negative consequences of actions stemming from hubris appear to be associated with a lack of knowledge, interest in, and exploration of [[history]], combined with overconfidence and a lack of [[humility]]. The common reference is 'The false pride that comes before the fall'.  Hubris as a pejorative term is often applied in the political realm. As hubris is associated with power, it is often used by persons associated with political parties that are out of power against those who are in power, specifically with regard to a perceived abuse of power.  Hubris has been suggested as one of the three virtues of successful programmers, according to [[Larry Wall]]. It is ''&quot;the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to  say bad things about.&quot;'' The other two virtues are [[laziness]] and [[impatience]].  ==References== {{wiktionary}} * {{cite book | first = Nick | last = Fisher | title = Hybris: a study in the values of honour and shame in Ancient Greece | location = [[Warminster]], UK | publisher = Aris &amp; Phillips | year = 1992 }} A book-length discussion of the meaning and implications of hybristic behavior in ancient Greece. {{1911}}  [[Category:Vice]]  [[da:Hybris]] [[de:Hybris]] [[es:Hibris]] [[fr:Hybris]] [[nl:Hybris]] [[pl:Hybris]] [[sv:Hybris]]</text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>Heavy water</title>     <id>14283</id>     <revision>       <id>41887239</id>       <timestamp>2006-03-02T10:47:18Z</timestamp>       <contributor>         <ip>84.12.111.6</ip>       </contributor>       <comment>minor grammer alteration</comment>       <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}} '''Heavy water''' is '''deuterium oxide''', or Deu iioyiu |oet[ 'qhu [,l,9g- 9

The first self-acting ram pump was invented by the Frenchman [[Montgolfier brothers|Joseph Michel Montgolfier]] in [[1796]] for raising water in his [[paper mill]] at [[Voiron]]. His friend [[Matthew Boulton]] took out an [[England|English]] patent on his behalf in [[1797]]. The sons of Montgolfier obtained an English patent for an improved version in [[1816]], and this was acquired, together with Whitehurst's design, in [[1820]] by [[Josiah Easton]], a [[Somerset]]-born engineer who had just moved to [[London]].    Easton's firm, inherited by his son [[James Easton|James]] ([[1796]] - [[1871]]), grew during the [[nineteenth century]] to become one of the more important engineering manufacturers in [[Britain]], with a large works at [[Erith]], [[Kent]]. They specialised in water supply and [[sewerage]] systems world-wide, as well as land [[drainage]] projects. Eastons had a good business supplying rams for water supply purposes to large [[country house]]s, and also to farms and village communities, and a number of their installations still survive in [[As of 2004|2004]].  The firm was eventually closed in [[1909]], but the ram business was continued by [[James R Easton]]. In [[1929]] it was acquired by [http://www.greenandcarter.com/ Green &amp; Carter], of [[Winchester]], [[Hampshire]], who were engaged in the manufacturing and installation of the well-known [[Vulcan ram|Vulcan]] and [[Vacher]] Rams. Green &amp; Carter now function from [[Ashbrittle]], near [[Wellington]], Somerset.  The first [[United States of America|US]] patent was issued to [[J. Cerneau]] and [[S.S. Hallet]] in [[1809]]. American interest in hydraulic rams picked up around [[1840]], as further patents were issued and domestic companies started offering rams for sale. Toward the end of the 19th Century, interest waned as [[electricity]] and electric [[pump]]s became widely available.   By the end of the [[twentieth century]] interest in hydraulic rams has revived, due to the needs of sustainable [[technology]] in [[developing countries]], and [[energy conservation]] in developed ones.  ==Construction and principle of operation== A hydraulic ram has only two moving parts, a spring or weight loaded &quot;waste&quot; [[valve]] sometimes known as the &quot;clack&quot; valve and a &quot;delivery&quot; [[check valve]], making it cheap to build, easy to maintain, and very reliable. In addition, there is a drive pipe supplying water from an elevated source, and a delivery pipe, taking a portion of the water that comes through the drive pipe to an elevation higher than the source.   ===Sequence of operation=== [[Image:Hydraulic Ram.gif|thumb|right|250px|Hydraulic ram:&lt;br&gt; 1.

Originally, IKEA sold [[pen]]s, [[wallet]]s, [[picture frame]]s, [[Furniture#table|table]] runners, [[watch]]es, [[Jewellery|jewelry]] and [[nylon]] [[stockings]] or practically anything Kamprad found a need for that he could fill with a product at a reduced price. [[Furniture]] was first added to the IKEA product range in [[1947]] and, in [[1955]], IKEA began to design its own furniture.

The country has extensive natural resources outside Java, including [[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[tin]], [[copper]] and [[gold]]. Indonesia is the world's second-largest exporter of natural gas, though it has recently become a net importer of crude oil. Major agricultural products include [[rice]], [[tea]], [[coffee]], [[spice]]s and [[rubber]].  The [[central bank]] of Indonesia is Bank Indonesia [http://www.bi.go.id].  Indonesia's major trading partners are [[Japan]], the [[United States]] and the surrounding nations of [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Australia]].  Despite being the only Asian member of [[OPEC]], Indonesia's fuel production has declined significantly over the years, owing to aging oil fields and lack of investment in new equipment.  As a result, despite being an exporter of crude oil, Indonesia is now a net importer of oil and had previously subsidized fuel prices to keep prices low, costing [[US$]] 7 billion in 2004 [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/GC10Ae04.html].  The current president has mandated a significant reduction of government subsidy of fuel prices in several stages [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4200100.stm].  In order to alleviate economic hardships, the government has offered one-time subsidies to qualified citizens.    The economy is now undergoing rebuilding after the December 2004 tsunami.  The government has stated to reduce subsidies, aiming to reduce the budget deficit to 1% of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) this year, down from around 1.6% last year.  ==Demographics== {{Main|Demographics of Indonesia}}  Indonesia's population statistics are difficult to estimate. In the 2000 national census, an initial population estimate of 203 million was recorded: most of the population of [[Aceh]] was estimated from previous counts as the conflict meant that a survey was not possible, as were hard-to-reach regions of [[Papua]]. The Indonesian government later revised the estimate up to 206 million. Internationally, an undercount had been assumed, though there is no data to confirm it. The country's Central Statistics Bureau ([http://www.bps.go.id BPS]) and '''Statistics Indonesia''' quote 219.9 million as the population for 2005, while the [[CIA Factbook]] estimates are over 240 million.  Some parts of Indonesia are some of the most densly populated areas in the world: for example, [[Java (island)|Java]] is the most populous island in the world and many Indonesian cities are some of the most populous and densely populated.  Indonesia's population can be roughly divided into two groups. The west of the country is Asian and the people are mostly [[Malay people|Malay]], while the east is more Pacific and people on New Guinea are Papuan, with roots in the islands of [[Melanesia]]. There are, however, many more subdivisions,  since Indonesia spans an area the size of Europe or the USA and consists of many islands that to a large degree had separate developmdh,qi'Al afi.heuh' ;h'ah.os'ut

The old [[Riksdag of the Estates|four-chamber Diet]] was re-activated in the [[1860s]] agreeing to supplementary new legislation concerning internal affairs. [[Industrialisation]] begun during the [[19th century]] from [[forestry]] to industry, mining and machinery and laid the foundation of Finland's current day prosperity, even though agriculture employed a relatively large part of the population until the post-WWII era.  ====Nationalism==== {{main|Finland's language strife}}  Particularly following Finland's incorporation into the Swedish central administration during the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]] had been the dominant language in administration and education. Before that, in medieval semi-anarchy, [[German Language|German]], [[Latin]] and Swedish were important languages beside native-spoken [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. Finnish recovered its predominance after a 19th-century resurgence of Finnish [[Nationalism]], and Russian controllers working to separate Finns from Sweden and to ensure the Finns' loyalty.  The publication in [[1835]] of the Finnish [[national epic]], the [[Kalevala]], a collection of traditional [[Mythology|myth]]s and [[legend]]s which is the [[folklore]] of the [[Karelian people]] (the [[Finnic]] [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] people who inhabit the [[Lake Ladoga]]-region of eastern Finland and present-day NW Russia), first stirred the [[nationalism]] that later led to Finland's [[independence]] from Russia. The Finnish national awakening in the mid-nineteenth century was the result of members of the Swedish-speaking upper classes deliberately choosing to promote Finnish culture and language as a means of [[nation building]], i.e. to establish a feeling of unity between all people in Finland including (and not of least importance) between the ruling [[elite]] and the ruled peasantry.  In 1863, Finnish gained a position in administration, and [[1892]] Finnish finally became an equal [[official language]] and gained a status comparable to that of Swedish. Within a generation Finnish clearly dominated in government and society.  ====Russification==== {{main|Russification of Finland}}  In [[1906]], as a means to improve Russo-Finnish relations, the old [[Riksdag of the Estates|four-chamber Diet]] was replaced by a [[unicameral]] [[Parliament]] ''(the &quot;[[Eduskunta]]&quot;),'' which was elected by universal suffrage, with Finnish women being the first in Europe to be given the vote.  ==Independence and Civil War== {{main articles|[[Finland's declaration of independence]], [[Finnish Civil War]]}}  In the aftermath of the [[February Revolution]] in Russia, Finland received a new [[Senate of Finland|Senate]], a coalition-Cabinet with the same power structure as the Finnish Parliament.

It is mainly designed for group (many-to-many) communication in discussion forums called ''channels'', but also allows one-to-one communication.  IRC was created by [[Jarkko Oikarinen]] (nickname &quot;WiZ&quot;) in late August 1988 to replace a program called [[MUT (software)|MUT]] (MultiUser [[Talk (Unix)|talk]]) on a [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] called OuluBox in [[Finland]].  Oikarinen found inspiration in [[Bitnet Relay Chat]] which operated on the [[Bitnet|Bitnet network]].   IRC gained prominence when it was used to report on the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991]] throughout a [[media blackout]]. It was previously used in a similar fashion by Kuwaitis during the [[Gulf War|Iraqi invasion]].  ==Technical information== IRC is an open [[network protocol|protocol]] that uses [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and optionally [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]].  An IRC server can connect to other IRC servers to expand the IRC network.  Users access IRC networks by connecting a client to a server.  There are many client and server implementations.  Most IRC servers do not require users to log in, but a user will have to set a nickname before being connected .  IRC is a plaintext protocol, which means that it is fully possible (though quite inconvenient) to use IRC via a basic byte-stream client such as [[netcat]] or [[telnet]]. However, the protocol only uses a slightly modified version of [[ASCII]], and does not originally provide any support for non-ASCII characters in text, with the result that many different, incompatible character encodings (such as [[ISO 8859-1]] and [[UTF-8]]) are used.   Because most IRC implementations use an [[acyclic graph]] as their connection model, there is no redundancy, and outage of a server or a link can cause a [[netsplit]].  ===Evolution=== All client-to-server IRC protocols in use today are descended from the protocol implemented in the irc2.8 version of the IRC2server, and documented in RFC 1459.  Since RFC 1459 was published, the new features in the irc2.10 implementation lee'g ,lolis.t'g,tq[d;;-'. ;;s;e

Generated seq by model:- m]]s and [[network card]]s.   It is important to notice that the previous designations of devices as either input or output change when the perspective changes. Mice and keyboards take as input physical movement that the human user outputs and convert it into signals that a computer can understand. The output from these devices is treated as input by the computer. Similarly, printers and monitors take as input signals that a computer outputs. They then convert these signals into representations that human users can see or read. (For a human user the process of reading or seeing these representations is receiving input.)  In computer architecture, the combination of the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and [[main memory]] (i.e. memory that the CPU can read and write to directly, with individual [[instruction set|instructions]]) is considered the heart of a computer, and any movement of information from or to that complex, for example to or from a [[disk drive]], is considered I/O. The CPU and its supporting circuitry provide [[I/O methods]] that are used in low-level [[computer programming]] in the implementation of [[device driver]]s.   Higher-level [[operating system]] and programming facilities employ separate, more abstract I/O concepts and [[primitive (computer science)|primitive]]s. For example, operating system provides application programs with the concept of [[computer file|file]]s. [[C programming language]] defines functions that allow programs to perform I/O through [[stream (computer)|stream]]s, such as read data from them and write data into them.   A rare alternative to special primitive functions is the IO [[monads in functional programming|monad]] that permits programs to just describe I/O, and the actions are carried out outside the program. This is notable because the I/O functions would introduce [[side-effect (computer science)|side-effect]]s to any programming language but now [[purely functional]] programming is practical.  == See also ==  * [[Direct memory access]] (DMA) * [[Hardware register]] * [[IPO Model]] * [[Interrupt]] * [[Programmed input/output]]  == External links == * [http://www.iometer.org/ I/O Meter]  [[Category:Input/Output| ]] [[Category:Computer architecture]] [[da:I/O]] [[et:I/O]] [[fr:EntrÃ©es Sorties]] [[it:Input/output]] [[lt:IÅ¡vesties Ä¯renginys]] [[ja:å¥åºå]] [[pt:I/O]] [[ru:Ð£ÑÑÑÐ¾Ð¹ÑÑÐ²Ð° Ð²Ð²Ð¾Ð´Ð°-Ð²ÑÐ²Ð¾Ð´Ð°]] [[zh:I/O]]</text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>Indictment</title>     <id>14559</id>     <revision>       <id>40750262</id>       <timestamp>2006-02-22T19:53:44Z</timestamp>       <contributor>         <username>Famspear</username>         <id>600513</id>       </contributor>       <comment>Revert vandal.</comment>       <text xml:space="preserve">{{CrimPro}} In the [[common law]] legal system, an '''indictment''' is a formal charge of having committed a serious criminal offence.

This included some fields of study which are no longer considered scientific. [[Bertrand Russell]]'s ''History of Philosophy'' gives a good account of the historical development of (natural) philosophy. In many cases, systematic learning about the natural world was a direct outgrowth of religion, often as a project of a particular religious community.  One important feature of &quot;pre-scientific&quot; inquiry (whether in the West or elsewhere) was reluctance to engage in experiment. For example, [[Aristotle]], one of the most prolific natural philosophers of antiquity, made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes of plants and animals. Aristotle focused on categorizing. He also made many observations on the large-scale workings of the universe, which led to the development of a comprehensive theory of physics; see [[Physics (Aristotle)]]. Yet, until the period of the [[Scientific Revolution]], the utility of experiment was unproven, which means that theories were never empirically tested. In [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophy, for example, the tradition of [[wu wei]] (action without action), would deprecate the setting up of ''artificial'' conditions in an experiment in fear they would produce contrived results that could never describe nature as it is in the world around us.  ==Early cultures== {{main articles|[[History of science in early cultures]] and [[Alchemy]]}}  In prehistoric times, advice and knowledge was passed from generation to generation in an [[oral tradition]]. The development of writing enabled knowledge to be stored and communicated across generations with much greater fidelity. Combined with the [[Origins of agriculture|development of agriculture]], which allowed for a surplus of food, it became possible for early civilizations to develop, because more time could be devoted to tasks other than survival.  Many ancient civilizations collected astronomical information in a systematic manner through simple observation.  Though they had no knowledge of the real physical structure of the planets and stars, many theoretical explanations were proposed.  Basic facts about human physiology were known in some places, and [[alchemy]] was practiced in several civilizations. Considerable observation of macrobiotic flora and fauna was also performed.  ==The Middle Ages== {{main|History of science in the Middle Ages}}  With the loss of the [[Western Roman Empire]], much of Europe lost contact with the knowledge of the pastoo it| sse;i&o[gl]eslqa o.hio;

For the 1996 national elections, the center-left parties created the [[Olive Tree]] coalition while the center-right united again under the [[House of Freedoms]].  {{main|Italian general election, 2001}} The May 2001 elections, where both coalitions used [[Mixed member proportional representation#Decoy lists|''decoy lists'']] to undermine the proportional-compensation part of the electoral system, ushered a refashioned center-right coalition dominated by Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, into power. The Olive Tree coalition now sits in the opposition.  This emerging bipolarity represents a major break from the fragmented, multi-party political landscape of the postwar era, although it appears to have reached a plateau, since efforts via referendums to further curtail the influence of small parties were defeated in [[1999]] and [[2000]]. The constant debate among the components of both coalitions is however intense, and some observers noted in this infighting some similarities with the previous system.  ===Latest elections=== {{Italian general election, 2001-Deputies}} {{Italian general election, 2001-Senate}} == Judicial branch==  The Italian judicial system is based on [[Roman law]] modified by the [[Napoleonic code]] and later [[statute]]s.

Its powers, volume, and frequency of decisions are not as extensive as those of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].

Subsequently, Iceland was occupied by the [[Allies]]. The Danish king remained the ''de jure'' sovereign of the nation until 1944, when the current [[republic]] was founded after the 1918 treaty had lapsed.  The new republic became a charter member of [[NATO]] in 1949 and signed a treaty with the [[United States]] in 1951 to take responsibility for the defense of Iceland. Today the US continues to operate a military base in [[KeflavÃ­k]] based on this agreement, while Iceland has no armed forces of its own. The economy of Iceland remained dependent on fisheries in the post-war decades and the country has had several clashes with its neighbours over this vital resource, most notably the [[Cod Wars]] with the [[United Kingdom|British]]. The economy has become more diverse recently owing to large investments in heavy industry such as [[aluminium]] smelting and deregulation and privatization in the financial sector. Iceland is a member of the [[Common market]] of the [[European Union|European Union]] through the [[European Economic Area|EEA agreement]] but has never applied for membership of the EU itself.  == Politics == {{main|Politics of Iceland}} [[Image:ogrimsson.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Ãlafur Ragnar GrÃ­msson]], President of Iceland]] [[Image:HalldÃ³rÃsgrÃ­msson.jpg|thumb|left|[[HalldÃ³r ÃsgrÃ­msson]], Prime Minister of Iceland]]  The modern parliament, called &quot;[[Althing]]&quot; or &quot;AlÃ¾ingi&quot;, was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the Danish king. It was widely seen as a reestablishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] period and suspended in 1799. It currently has 63 members, each of whom is elected by the population every four years. The [[president of Iceland]] is a largely ceremonial office that serves as a diplomat, figurehead and [[head of state]]. The [[head of government]] is the prime minister, who, together with the cabinet, takes care of the executive part of government. The cabinet is appointed by the president after general elections to Althing; however, this process is usually conducted by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how its seats are to be distributed (under the condition that it has a majority support in Althing). Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves in reasonable time does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet himself. This has never happened since the republic was founded in 1944, but in 1942 the regent of the country ([[Sveinn BjÃ¶rnsson]], who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941) did appoint a non-parliamentary government. The regent had, for all practical purposes, the position of a president, and BjÃ¶rnsson in fact became the country's first president in 1944.

The letters ''J'', ''K'', ''W'', ''X'' and'' Y'' are not part of the standard Italian alphabet, but are seen in imported words (such as ''jeans'', ''whiskey'', ''taxi''). ''J'' may also appear in many words from different dialects. Each of these foreign letters had an Italian equivalent spelling: ''gi'',  ''ch'', ''u'', ''cs'' or ''s'', and ''i'', but these are now obsolete.  * Italian uses the [[acute accent]] over the letter ''E'' (as in ''perchÃ©'', why/because) to indicate a mid-close vowel, and the [[grave accent]] (as in ''tÃ¨'', tea) to indicate a mid-open vowel. The [[grave accent]] is also used on letters ''A'', ''I'', ''O'', and ''U'' to mark the stress position when it is on the last letter of a word (for instance ''gioventÃ¹'', youth). Typically, the penultimate syllable is stressed. If other syllables are stressed, marking an accent is not mandatory, as is instead done in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and, in virtually all cases, no accent is marked. In some cases, when the word is ambiguous (as ''principi''), the accent is sometimes marked in order to disambiguate the meaning (in this case, ''prÃ­ncipi'', princes, or ''princÃ­pi'', principles; ''balia'', nurse or ''balÃ¬a'', force  * The letter ''H'' is always silent when it begins a word, and is only used to distinguish ''ho'', ''hai'', ''ha'', ''hanno'' (present indicative of ''avere'', to have) from ''o'' (or), ''ai'' (to the), ''a'' (to), ''anno'' (year). ''H'' is otherwise used for some combinations with other letters (see below), but the /h/ sound does not exist in Italian.  * The letter ''Z'' is pronounced {{IPA|/dz/}}, for example: ''Zanzara'' {{IPA|/dzanËdzara/}} (mosquito), or sometimes {{IPA|/ts/}}, for example: ''Nazione'' {{IPA|/naËtsione/}} (nation), depending on context, though there are few minimal pairs.

The Act provided for the sole use of English in official proceedings in Wales, inconveniencing the numerous speakers of the [[Welsh language]].  Henry continued with his persecution of his religious opponents. In 1536, an uprising known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]] broke out in [[Northern England]]. To appease the rebellious Roman Catholics, Henry agreed to allow Parliament to address their concerns. Furthermore, he agreed to grant a general pardon to all those involved. He kept neither promise, and a second uprising occurred in 1537. As a result, the leaders of the rebellion were convicted of treason and executed. In 1538, Henry sanctioned the destruction of shrines to Roman Catholic Saints. In 1539, England's remaining monasteries were all dissolved, and their property transferred to the Crown. As a reward for his role, Thomas Cromwell was created [[Earl of Essex]]. [[Abbot]]s and [[prior]]s lost their seats in the [[House of Lords]]; only archbishops and bishops came to comprise the ecclesiastical element of the body.

Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex suggested [[Anne of Cleves|Anne]], the sister of the Protestant [[Duchy of Cleves|Duke of Cleves]], who was seen as an important ally in case of a Roman Catholic attack on England.  [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was dispatched to Cleves to paint a portrait of Anne for the King.  After regarding Holbein's flattering portrayal, and urged by the complimentary description of Anne given by his courtiers, Henry agreed to wed Anne. On Anne's arrival in England, Henry is said to have found her utterly unattractive, privately calling her a &quot;Flanders Mare&quot;. She was painted totally without any signs of her pockmarked face. Nevertheless, he married her on [[6 January]] [[1540]].  Soon thereafter, however, Henry desired to end the marriage, not only because of his personal feelings but also because of political considerations. The Duke of Cleves had become engaged in a dispute with the Holy Roman Emperor, with whom Henry had no desire to quarrel. Queen Anne was intelligent enough not to impede Henry's quest for an annulment. She testified that her marriage was never consummated. Henry was said to have come into the room each night and merely kissed his new bride on the forehead before sleeping. The marriage was subsequently annulled on the grounds that Anne had previously been contracted to marry another European nobleman.

The country is divided into multiple zones, called circles (roughly along state boundaries) and the four largest cities ([[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Chennai]]) are circles in their own right. The government owned [[BSNL]] runs local, mobile and long distance telephone services all over the country (except in the Delhi and Mumbai circles). Several private companies give competition to BSNL/[[MTNL]] in different circles.  ''Landlines:'' Landline service in India is primarily run by [[BSNL]] ([[MTNL]] in Delhi and Mumbai). There are other companies too, such as [[Touchtel]] and [[Tata Teleservices]] which do not have a pan-Indian presence. [[Reliance Infocomm]] has licences to provide services all over the country, but have started off only with [[CDMA]] mobile and fixed mobile services (where the phone is not wired to the exchange, but is used like a fixed line at home or office).   Landlines are now facing competition from mobile telephones ([[GSM]] and CDMA based). Mobile phone connections are readily available from private companies for relatively low prices. The competition has forced the government owned monopoly BSNL (MTNL in Delhi and Mumbai) to become more efficient. The landline network quality has improved and landline connections are now usually available on demand, even in high density urban areas. In addition to the government monopoly, there are several private landline telephone companies, notably Reliance and Tata Teleservices and [[Bharti]] (which runs the landline company Touchtel and the mobile company [[Airtel]]).  Long distance service is now more comprehensive and cheaper, carried primarily on fiber optic cable. There are several private long distance companies, the government owned [[BSNL]] continues to use its monopoly against them. However, the competition has caused prices to drop and calls across India are now comparable in price to calls across the continental United States.  The [[subscriber trunk dialling|STD]] codes within India are: {|  | Bangalore | (0)80 |- | Mumbai | (0)22 |- | Kolkata | (0)33 |- | [[Dehradun]]  | (0)135  |-  | [[Delhi]]  | (0)11  |}  ''Mobile Cellular:'' The mobile service has seen phenomenal growth since [[2000]]. In fact, in September, 2004 the number of mobile phone connections have crossed fixed-line connections. Currently there are an estimated 50 million mobile phone users in India compared to 45 meec-i 9lte.cisil ;hlhy mlus]l'

Generated seq by model:- rean speech were inaccurate and difficult to learn for the common people. (Hence the name ''Hunmin Jeong-eum,'' which means &quot;Correct Sounds for the Education of the People&quot; in [[Sino-Korean]]).  At that time, only male members of the aristocracy ([[Yangban]]) learned to read and write [[Hanja]]. Since written material was only available in Hanja, most Koreans were effectively illiterate.  Hangul faced heavy opposition by the literate elite, who believed Hanja to be the only legitimate writing system. The protest by [[Choe Manri]] and other [[Confucian]] scholars in 1444 is a typical example.   Later the government became apathetic to Hangul. [[Yeonsangun of Joseon|Yeonsangun]], the 10th king, forbade the study or use of Hangul and banned Hangul documents in 1504, and [[Jungjong of Joseon|King Jungjong]] abolished the Ministry of Eonmun in 1506. Until this time Hangul had been used by women and the uneducated.  In late 19th century, Korean nationalism increased as Japan attempted to sever Korea from China's sphere of influence. Hangul began to be considered as a national symbol by some reformists. As a result of the [[Gabo Reform]] (ê°ì¤ ê°í) by pro-Japanese politicians, Hangul was adopted in official documents for the first time in 1894. After Korea was annexed by Japan in 1910, Hangul was briefly taught in schools, but later banned as Japan enforced a [[cultural assimilation]] policy. Further standardization took place under Japanese occupation such as the publication of the [[:wikisource:ko:íê¸ ë§ì¶¤ë² íµì¼ì|standardized system of Hangul]] on October 29 1933, changing the number of vowels to 24. In 1940 the system for expressing foreign orthographies in Hangul was also published.  After regaining independence from Japan in 1945, Hangul has been extensively used as the offical writing of Korea. Some elites still have preferred mixed use of Hanja (mostly for nouns) in Hangul-written sentences, but generally the mixed use of Hanja has been ever-decreasing. Today, it is hard to find instances of Hanja use within Hangul sentences in normal written publications or documents, though newspapers often use hanja to avoid ambiguity in headlines.  ==''Jamo''== {{see also|Hangul consonant and vowel tables}} '''''Jamo''''' (ìëª¨; [[Hanja|å­æ¯]]) or ''nassori'' (ë±ìë¦¬) are the letters that make up the Hangul alphabet.  '''''Ja''''' means letter or character, and '''''mo''''' means mother, so the name signifies that the ''jamo'' are the building-blocks of the script.  There are 51 ''jamo'', of which 24 are equivalents to [[letter]]s of the [[Roman alphabet]].  The other 27 are clusters of two or sometimes three ''jamo''.  Of the 24 simple ''jamo'', fourteen are [[consonant]]s (''ja-eum'' ìì, å­é³: literally &quot;child sounds&quot;) and ten are [[vowel]]s (''mo-eum'' ëª¨ì, æ¯é³: literally &quot;mother sounds&quot;). Five of the simple consonants are doubled to form the five tense consonants (see below), while another eleven clusters are formed of two different consonants.

Following Lasswell&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; he states that âa person identifies himself with a group when, in making a decision, he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified groupâ&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. A person may identify himself, or herself with any number of social, geographic, economic, racial, religious, familial, educational, gender, political, and sports groups. Indeed, the number and variety are unlimited, and ubiquitous. The fundamental problem for organizations is to recognize that personal and group identifications can either facilitate or obstruct correct decision making for the organization. A specific organization has to deliberately determine and specify in appropriate detail and clear language its own goals, objectives, means, ends, and values. It is further desired that these important factors be internalized in the psychology of the individual participants.   Chester Bernard is cited as responsible for pointing out that âthe decisions that an individual makes as a member of an organization are quite distinct from his personal decisionsâ&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. Personal choices may determine whether an individual joins a particular organization, and continue to be made in his or her extraâorganizational private life. But,as a member of an organization, that individual makes decisions not in relationship to personal needs and results, but in an impersonal sense as part of the organizational intent, purpose, and effect. Organizational inducements, rewards, and sanctions are all designed to form, strengthen, and maintain this identification.  The correctness of decisions are measured by two major criteria:1.adequacy of achieving the desired objective; and 2.the efficiency with which the result was obtained. Many members of the organization may focus on adequacy,but the overall administrative management must pay particular attention to the efficiency with which the desired result was abtained with the utilization or expenditure of minimum resources.

Its combination of low cost and high strength make it indispensable, especially in applications like [[automobile]]s, the [[hull (ship)|hull]]s of large [[ship]]s, and structural components for [[building]]s. [[Steel]] is the best known alloy of iron, and some of the forms that iron takes include:  * [[Pig iron]] has 4% &amp;ndash; 5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as [[sulfur]], [[silicon]] and [[phosphorus]]. Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from [[iron ore]] to [[cast iron]] and [[steel]]. * [[Cast iron]] contains 2% &amp;ndash; 4.0% [[carbon]] , 1% &amp;ndash; 6% [[silicon]] , and small amounts of [[manganese]]. Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect the material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level.  It has a melting point in the range of 1420&amp;ndash;1470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form [[carbon]] takes in the alloy. 'White' cast irons contain their carbon in the form of [[cementite]], or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation.  In 'grey' cast iron, the carbon exists free as fine flakes of [[graphite]] , and also, renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as 'ductile iron' is specially treated with trace amounts of [[magnesium]] to alter the shape of graphite to sheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material. * [[Carbon steel]] contains between 0.4% and 1.5% [[carbon]], with small amounts of [[manganese]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], and [[silicon]]. * [[Wrought iron]] contains less than 0.2% carbon. It is a tough, malleable product, not as fusible as pig iron. It has a very small amount of carbon, a few tenths of a percent. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised, especially in old samples, by the presence of fine 'stringers' or filaments of [[slag]] entrapped in the metal. * [[Alloy steel]]s contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as [[chromium]], [[vanadium]], [[molybdenum]], [[nickel]], [[tungsten]], etc. They are used for structural purposes, as their alloy content raises their cost and necessitates justification of their use. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and c'&;'-llh e8uir9 9r;;9rpr aife

Then  :&lt;math&gt; H^s(E) = \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0} H^s_\delta(E). &lt;/math&gt;  We can succinctly (though not in a very useful way) describe the value ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'') as the [[infimum]] of all ''h'' &gt; 0 such that for all &amp;delta; &gt; 0, ''E'' can be covered by [[countable|countably many]] closed sets of diameter &amp;le; &amp;delta; and the sum of the ''s''-th powers of these diameters is less than or equal to ''h''.  ==Results== The Hausdorff outer measure ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; is defined for all subsets of ''X''.  However, we can in general assert additivity properties, that is   : &lt;math&gt; H^s(A \cup B) = H^s(A) + H^s(B) &lt;/math&gt;  for disjoint ''A'', ''B'', only when  ''A'' and  ''B'' satisfy some additional condition, such as both being [[Borel algebra|Borel sets]] (or more generally, that they are both measurable sets).  From the perspective of assigning measure and dimension to sets with unusual metric properties such as fractals, however, this is not a restriction.   '''Theorem'''. ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; is a metric outer measure.  Thus all Borel subsets of ''X'' are measurable and ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; is a countably additive measure on the &amp;sigma;-algebra of Borel sets.  Clearly, if (''X'', ''d'') and (''Y'', ''e'') are [[isomorphic]] metric spaces, then the corresponding Hausdorff measure spaces are also isomorphic. It is more useful to note however that Hausdorff measure even behaves well under certain bounded modifications of the underlying metric.  Hausdorff measure is a [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz]] invariant in the following sense:  If ''d'' and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are metrics on ''X'' such that for some ''0&lt; C &lt; &amp;infin;'' and all ''x'', ''y'' in ''X'',  :&lt;math&gt;  C^{-1} d_1(x,y) \leq d(x,y) \leq C d_1(x,y) &lt;/math&gt; then the corresponding Hausdorff measures ''H''&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; satisfy :&lt;math&gt; C^{-s} H^s_1(E) \leq H^s(E) \leq C^s H^s_1(E)&lt;/math&gt; for any Borel set ''E''.  The function ''s'' &amp;rarr; ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'') is non-increasing. In fact, it turns out that for all values of ''s'', except possibly one  ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'') is either 0 or &amp;infin;. We say ''E'' has positive finite Hausdorff dimension iff there is a real number 0&lt;''d''&lt; &amp;infin; such that if ''s'' &lt; ''d'' then ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'') = &amp;infin; and if ''s'' &gt; ''d'', then ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'') = 0. If ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'')=0 for all positive ''s'', then ''E'' has Hausdorff dimension 0.  Finally, if ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'')=&amp;infin; for all positive ''s'', then ''E'' has Hausdorff dimension &amp;infin;   The Hausdorff dimension is a well-defined extended [[real number]] for any set ''E'' and we always havei- s9d9t ;i;  hl tiee h]e8 to

Balderus is not completely defeated and shortly afterwards returns to defeat HÃ¸therus in the field. But Balderus's victory is without fruit for he is still without Nanna. Lovesick he is harassed by phantoms in Nanna's likeness and his health deteriorates so that he cannot walk but has himself drawn around in a cart.  After a while HÃ¸therus and Balderus have their third battle and again HÃ¸therus is forced to retreat. Weary of life because of his misfortunes against Balderus he plans to retire and wanders into the wilderness. In a cave he comes upon the same maidens he had met at the start of his career. Now they tell him that he can defeat Balderus if he gets a taste of some extraordinary food which had been devised to increase the strength of Balderus.  Encouraged by this HÃ¸therus returns from exile and once again meets Balderus in the field. After a day of inconclusive fighting HÃ¸therus goes out during the night to spy on the enemy. He finds where Balderus's magical food is prepared and plays the lyre for the maidens preparing it. While they don't want to give him the food they bestow on him a belt and a girdle which secure victory.  Heading back to his camp, HÃ¸therus meets Balderus and plunges his sword into his side. After three days Balderus dies from his wound.

He was the second monarch of the [[Tudor dynasty]], succeeding his father, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. He is famous for having been [[Wives of Henry VIII|married six times]] and for wielding the most untrammeled power of any British monarch.  Notable events during his reign included the break with [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]] and the subsequent establishment of the independent [[Church of England]], the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], and the union of [[England]] and [[Wales]].  Several significant pieces of legislation were enacted during Henry VIII's reign.  They included the several Acts which severed the English Church from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] &lt;!--He broke with ROMAN Catholicism but not with Catholicism. Edward VI broke with Catholicism.--&gt; and established Henry as the supreme head of the Church in England, the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542]] (which united England and Wales into one nation), the [[Buggery Act 1533]], the first anti-[[sodomy]] enactment in England; and the [[Witchcraft Act|Witchcraft Act 1542]], which punished 'invoking or conjuring an evil spirit' with death.  Henry VIII is known to have been an avid [[gambling|gambler]] and [[dice]] player. He excelled at sport, especially jousting, hunting, and [[real tennis|royal tennis]], during his youth. He was also an accomplished musician, author, and [[poetry|poet]]; his best known piece of music is ''[[Pastyme With Good Company]]'' (The Kynges Ballade). Henry VIII was also involved in the construction-from-scratch and improvement of several significant buildings, including [[Nonsuch Palace]], [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College Chapel]] and [[Westminster Abbey]] - the existing buildings improved were often properties confiscated from [[Thomas Cardinal Wolsey|Wolsey]] (such as [[Christ Church, Oxford]], [[Hampton Court Palace]] and [[palace of Whitehall]]).   ==Early life==   [[Image:The Palace of Placentia.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;small&gt;The future Henry VIII was born at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich in 1491.&lt;/small&gt;]] Born at the [[Palace of Placentia]] at [[Greenwich]], Henry VIII was the third child of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and [[Elizabeth of York]].

It regained the rights to the Hero System and to the Champions trademark.  In [[2001]], the Fifth Edition of the Hero System Rulebook was released that had been heavily revised by Long.

Also in 2004, a condensed version of the rulebook called [[HERO System Sidekick]] was released with a cover price of under $10.  == Trivia == * When preparations were made for the release of the Fifth Edition rulebook, Steve Long was asked what fans should use as a shorthand for the new release. He was quoted as saying &quot;I don't care if you call it ''Fred'', as long as you buy it.&quot; The name stuck, and the Fifth Edition is frequently referred to in fandom as FREd, which is claimed to stand for &quot;Fifth Rules Edition&quot;.

Generated seq by model:- as a rich and prosperous record.  ==Irish landholdings== The catastrophe that was the Famine was the product of a number of complex problems which affected nineteenth century Ireland. One of the most central was the nature of land-holdings. From the middle ages onwards, Irish ownership of the land of the island had been in decline, as waves of settlers, from the [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabethan]] [[Plantations of Ireland|plantations]] on, assumed control of large tracts of land. A practice of consolidation of lands into large estates was widespread in Europe, but, in Ireland, it was complicated by the discriminatory laws applied to all faiths other than the established [[Church of Ireland]], but which most directly affected Irish Roman Catholics, by far the religion of the overwhelming majority of Irish people. Under the [[Penal Laws]], Irish Catholics faced the threat of confiscation of property. While the enforcement of the law fluctuated both in terms of period and geography, and by the time of the Famine the laws had in any case been repealed, the cultural effect of the discrimination they embodied helped shape Irish attitudes towards land. As a result of all of this, by the time of the Famine most Irish Catholics were restricted to holding small, frequently impoverished tenancies, lacking what came to be known as the '[[Three Fs|Three Fs]]'; fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale.    This was further complicated by a cultural tradition known as [[Irish farm subdivision|'sub-division']], whereby lands and property, instead of being inherited by the first-born son ([[primogeniture]]) was divided equally among male heirs, both legitimate and on occasion illegitimate. The Penal Laws had decreed sub-division among the conquered Catholic Irish, in the hopes of encouraging conversion to Protestantism. In its nineteenth century land-holding form, it meant that, over each generation, the size of a tenant farm was reduced, as it was split between all living sons, though by the 1840s, sub-division was increasingly only found among the poorest people on the smallest farms.  In 1845, for example, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4 to 2 [[hectare]]s (one to five [[acre]]s) in size, while 40% were of 2 to 6 hectares (five to fifteen acres). This included [[marsh|marshland]] and [[bog|bogland]] that could not be used for food production. As a result, holdings were so small that the only crop that could be grown in sufficient quantities, and which provided sufficient nourishment to feed a family, was potatoes. A British Government report carried out shortly before the Famine noted that the scale of the poverty was such that one third of all small holdings in Ireland were presumed to be unable to support their families, after paying their rent, other than through the earnings of seasonal migrant labour in [[England]] and [[Scotland]]. {{fn|1}}  As a result, the Irish landholding system in the 1840s was already in serious trouble.

On the other hand, God has existed forever. Arius felt that any attempt to recognize the deity of Christ would blur the lines between Christianity and the Pagan religions. If Christianity recognized two separate gods, the Father and Jesus, it would become a polytheistic religion.  Although most writings of Arius were destroyed by the early Catholic Church and the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], we can infer from [[Athanasius]]' arguments against Arius some idea of the movement.  Basically, Arius was a leader of Christians who had a very particular understanding of the early [[trinitarianism]] movement, reflecting the divine nature of Christ.  Arius' hypothesis, to our knowledge, was that Jesus was created by God (as in, &quot;There was a time when the Son was not&quot;), and hence, was secondary to God. His primary proof text was John 17:3. Athanasius' position was that Jesus was and always had been divine, and had a divine nature along with the Father and the Holy Spirit.  ====Gnosticism==== A Greek philosophical/religious movemr2ri9 tgeo1; ;'eh0h .8tlo t[ih

The marriage was subsequently annulled on the grounds that Anne had previously been contracted to marry another European nobleman. She received the title of &quot;The King's Sister&quot;, and was granted [[Hever Castle]], the former residence of Anne Boleyn's family. The Earl of Essex, meanwhile, fell out of favour for his role in arranging the marriage, and was subsequently [[attainder|attainted]] and beheaded. The office of Vicegerent in Spirituals, which had been specifically created for him, was not filled, and still remains vacant.  On [[28 July]] [[1540]] (the same day Lord Essex was executed) Henry married the young [[Catherine Howard]], Anne Boleyn's first cousin. Soon after her marriage, however, Queen Catherine may have had an affair with the courtier, [[Thomas Culpeper]]. She also employed [[Francis Dereham]], who was previously informally engaged to her and had an affair with her prior to her marriage, as her secretary. Thomas Cranmer, who was opposed to the powerful Catholic Howard family, brought evidence of Queen Catherine's activities to the King's notice.  Though Henry originally refused to believe the allegations, he allowed Cranmer to conduct an investigation, which resulted in Queen Catherine's implication. When questioned, the Queen could have admitted a prior contract to marry Dereham, which would have made her subsequent marriage to Henry invalid, but she instead claimed that Dereham had forced her to enter into an adulterous relationship. Dereham, meanwhile, exposed Queen Catherine's relationship with Thomas Culpeper.  In December 1541, Culpeper and Dereham were executed. Catherine was condemned not by a trial, but by an [[Act of Attainder]] passed by Parliament. The Act recited the evidence against the Queen, and Henry would have been obliged to listen to the entire text before granting the [[Royal Assent]]. Because &quot;the repetition of so grievous a Story and the recital of so infamous a crime&quot; in the King's presence &quot;might reopen a Wound already closing in the Royal Bosom&quot;, a special clause permitting Commissioners to grant the Royal Assent on the King's behalf was inserted in the Act. This method of granting the Royal Assent had never been used before, but, in later reigns, it came to replace the traditional personal appearance of the Sovereign in Parliament.  Catherine's marriage was annulled shortly before her execution.  As was the case with Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard could not have technically been guilty of adultery, as the marriage was officially null and void from the beginning.  Again, this point was ignored, and Catherine was executed on [[13 February]] [[1542]].  She was only about eighteen years old at the time.  Henry married his last wife, the wealthy widow [[Catherine Parr]], in 1543.  She argued with Henry over religion; she was a Protestant, but Henry remained a Catholic. This behaviour almost led to her undoing, but she saved herself by a show of submissiveness.  She helped reconcile Henry with his first hh o1u;e   m]s 9;iahlo 2i;r;ea

Generated seq by model:- ficiency is still roughly five times lower than petrol. This is why hydrogen must be compressed if there is to be a useful amount of stored energy. Except in the case of the Hydrogen on Demand process, designed by Steven Amendola, where hydrogen is created as it is needed.  All internal combustion engines must have a means of [[ignition system|ignition]] to promote combustion. Most engines use either an [[spark plug|electrical]] or a [[compression heating ignition]] system. Electrical ignition systems generally rely on a [[lead-acid battery]] and an [[induction coil]] to provide a high voltage electrical spark to ignite the air-fuel mix in the engine's cylinders. This battery can be recharged during operation using an ''[[alternator]]'' driven by the engine. Compression heating ignition systems ([[Diesel engine]]s and [[HCCI]] engines) rely on the heat created in the air by compression in the engine's cylinders to ignite the fuel.  Once successfully ignited and burnt, the combustion products (hot [[gas]]es) have more available energy than the original compressed fuel/air mixture (which had higher [[chemical energy]]). The available energy is manifested as high [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] which can be translated into [[Mechanical work|work]] by the engine. In a reciprocating engine, the high pressure product gases inside the cylinders drive the engine's pistons.  Once the available energy has been removed the remaining hot gases are vented (often by opening a [[poppet valve|valve]] or exposing the exhaust outlet) and this allows the piston to return to its previous position (Top Dead Center - TDC). The piston can then proceed to the next phase of its cycle (which varies between engines). Any [[heat]] not translated into work is a waste product and is removed from the engine either by an air or liquid cooling system.  ==Parts== [[Image:Four stroke cycle compression.jpg|thumb|An illustration of several key components in a typical [[four-stroke cycle|four-stroke]] engine]]  The parts of an engine vary depending on the engine's type. For a [[four-stroke cycle|four-stroke]] engine, key parts of the engine include the [[crankshaft]] (purple), one or more [[camshaft]]s (red and blue) and [[poppet valve|valve]]s. For a [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]] engine, there may simply be an exhaust outlet and fuel inlet instead of a valve system. In both types of engines, there are one or more cylinders (grey and green) and for each cylinder there is a [[spark plug]] (darker-grey), a [[piston]] (yellow) and a [[crank (mechanism)|crank]] (purple). A single sweep of the cylinder by the piston in an upward or downward motion is known as a stroke and the downward stroke that occurs directly after the air-fuel mix in the cylinder is ignited is known as a power stroke.  A [[Wankel engine]] has a triangular rotor that orbits in an [[epitroichoid]]al (figure 8 shape) chamber around an eccentric shaft. The four phases of operation (intake, compression, power, exhaust) take place in separate locations, instead of one single location as in a hi]d;c[| i][g  l-*  ]euirat'

HÃ¸therus goes to consult with King Gevarus and asks him for his daughter. The king replies that he would gladly favour him but that Balderus has already offered a like request and he does not want to incur his wrath.  Gevarus tells HÃ¸therus that Balderus is invincible but that he knows of one weapon which can defeat him, a sword kept by [[Mimingus]], the satyr of the woods. Mimingus also has another magical artifact, a bracelet that increases the wealth of its owner. Riding through a region of extraordinary cold in a carriage drawn by reindeer HÃ¸therus captures the satyr with a clever ruse and forces him to yield his artifacts.  Hearing about HÃ¸therus's artifacts, Gelderus, king of Saxony, equips a fleet to attack him. Gevarus warns HÃ¸therus of this and tells him where to meet Gelderus in battle. When the battle is joined, HÃ¸therus and his men save their missiles while defending themselves against those of the enemy with a [[testudo formation]]. With his missiles exhausted, Gelderus is forced to sue for peace. He is treated mercifully by HÃ¸therus and becomes his ally. HÃ¸therus then gains another ally with his eloquent oratory by helping King Helgo of [[HÃ¥logaland]] win a bride.  Meanwhile Balderus enters the country of king Gevarus armed and sues for Nanna. Gevarus tells him to learn Nanna's own mind. Balderus addresses her with cajoling words but obtains a refusal. Nanna tells him that because of the great difference in their nature and stature, since he is a demigod, they are not suitable for marriage.   As news of Balderus's efforts reaches HÃ¸therus he and his allies resolve to attack Balderus. A great naval battle ensues where the gods fight on the side of Balderus. [[Thor]]o in particular shatters all opposition with his mighty club. As the battle seems lost HÃ¸therus manages to hew Thoro's club off at the haft and the gods are forced to retreat. Gelderus perishes in the battle and HÃ¸therus arranges a funeral pyre of vessels for him. After this battle HÃ¸therus finally marries Nanna.  Balderus is not completely defeated and shortly afterwards returns to defeat HÃ¸therus in the field. But Balderus's victory is without fruit for he is still without Nanna. Lovesick he is harassed by phantoms in Nanna's likeness and his health deteriorates so that he cannot walk but has himself drawn around in a cart.  After a while HÃ¸therus and Balderus have their third battle and again HÃ¸therus is forced to retreat. Weary of life because of his misfortunes against Balderus he plans to retire and wanders into the wilderness. In a cave he comes upon the same maidens he had met at the start of his career. Now they tell him that he can defeat Balderus if he gets a taste of some extraordinary food which had been devised to increase the strength of Balderus.  Encouraged by this HÃ¸therus returns from exile and once again meets Balderus in the field. After a day of inconclusive fighting HÃ¸therus goes out during oeu.9patte e d r  rii1s*i'tiey

A disjunct population occurs in east-central Missouri. The '''Ozark Hellbender''' (''C. a. bishopi'') subspecies exists as a disjunct population in southeastern [[Missouri]] and adjacent [[Arkansas]].  ==Anatomy &amp; Physiology== Hellbenders have a flat body and head, with small eyes. Like all [[salamanders]], they have short legs and thin bodies. Their tails, however, are especially keeled to help propel them through water. They have four toes on their front legs and five on their back ones. Although the Hellbender has working lungs, there is a single [[gill]] slit along each side of its neck, resembling fleshy folds. They reach lengths of eighteen to twenty-nine inches (forty-six to seventy-four centimeters), and weigh in at about three to five pounds. Their primary sources of food are crayfish, snails and worms. They have powerful jaws and can inflict a painful bite. Male Hellbenders are territorial and physically compete for nesting areas. Hellbenders may live up to twenty-nine years in captivity, and follow a normal amphibious life cycle.  ==Reproduction== Females lay between 200 and 500 eggs after their breeding period in late August through September. Eggs are deposited in a nest made by the male under a large rock and will be guarded by the male until the eggs hatch after 2-3 months of gestation.  ==External links and references== * [http://www.dgif.state.va.us/wildlife/species/display.asp?id=020020 Commonwealth of Virginia Hellbender Information] * [http://www.dec.state.ny.us/website/dfwmr/wildlife/endspec/hellfs.html State of New York Hellbender Information] * [http://ecos.fws.gov/species_profile/SpeciesProfile?spcode=D032 U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service Endangered Species Program] * [http://hellbenders.sanwalddesigns.com/ The Hellbender Homepage]  [[Category:Salamanders]]  [[es:Cryptobranchus alleganiensis]] [[nl:Noord-Amerikaanse modderduivel]]</text>    t&td g[y9o; l-ir ;i-1o.e;choso

King FaysÄl II and `Abd al-IlÄh were executed in the gardens of ar-RihÄb Palace. Their bodies (and those of many others in the royal family) were displayed in public. NÅ«rÄ« as-Sa`Ä«d evaded capture for one day, but after attempting to escape disguised as a veiled woman, he was caught and shot.  The new government proclaimed Iraq to be a [[republic]] and rejected the idea of a union with Jordan. Iraq's activity in the BaghdÄd Pact ceased.  When QÄsim distanced himself from `Abd an-NÄsir, he faced growing opposition from pro-Egypt officers in the Iraqi army. `Arif, who wanted closer cooperation with Egypt, was stripped of his responsibilities and after a convenient trial thrown in prison.  When the garrison in [[Mosul]] rebelled against QÄsim's policies, he allowed the Kurdish leader BarzÄnÄ« to return from exile in the Soviet Union to help suppress the pro-NÄsir rebels.  In [[1961]], [[Kuwait]] gained independence from Britain and Iraq claimed sovereignty over Kuwait. Britain reacted strongly to Iraq's claim and sent troops to Kuwait to deter Iraq. QÄsim was forced to back down and in October [[1963]], Iraq recognised the sovereignty of Kuwait.  A period of considerable instability followed. QÄsim was assassinated in February [[1963]], when the [[Ba'ath Party|Ba`th Party]] took power under the leadership of General [[Ahmed Hasan al-Bakr|Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr]] ([[prime minister]]) and Colonel [[Abdul Salam Arif|`Abd as-SalÄm `Arif]] (president). Nine months later `Abd as-Salam Muhammad `Arif led a successful coup against the Ba`th government. On [[13 April]] [[1966]], President `Abd as-SalÄm `Arif died in a helicopter crash and was succeeded by his brother, General [[Abdul Rahman Arif|`Abd ar-Rahman `Arif]]. Following the [[Six Day War]] of [[1967]], the Ba`th Party felt strong enough to retake power ([[17 July]] [[1968]]). Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr became president and chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC).  BarzÄnÄ« and the Kurds who had begun a rebellion in 1961 were still causing problems in 1969. The secretary-general of the Ba`th party [[Saddam Hussein|SaddÄm Husayn]] was given responsibility to find a solution. It was clear that it was impossible to defeat the Kurds by military means and in [[1970]] a political agreement was reached between the rebels and the Iraqi government.  Iraq's economy recovered sharply after the 1968 revolution. The Arif brothers had spent close to 90% of the national budget on the army but the Ba`th government gave priority to agriculture and industry. The British [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] monopoly was broken when a new contract was signed with [[ERAP]], a major French oil company. Later the IPC was nationalised. As a result of these policies Iraq experienced fast economic growth.  During the 1970s, border disputes with Iran and Kuwait caused many problems. Kuwait's ras l ooeh, ah&m'ahyses aa1|Ca1

Inuit made clothes and footwear from animal skins, sewn together using needles made from animal bones and threads made from other animal products.

The hoods of Inuit women's parkas - ''amautiit'' (singular ''amauti'', ''amaut'' or ''amautik'') in Inuktitut - were traditionally made extra large, to protect the baby from the harsh wind when snuggled against the mother's back. Styles vary from region to region, from shape of the hood to length of the tails. Boots (Inuktitut: ''kamik'' or ''[[mukluk]]'') could be made of caribou or sealskin, and designs varied for men and women.  Inuit also lived in temporary shelters made from snow in winter (the famous ''[[igloo]]''), and during the few months of the year when temperatures were above freezing, they lived in tents made of animal skins and bones.  The division of labour in traditional society had a strong gender component.  The men were traditionally hunters and fishermen. The women took care of the children, cleaned huts, sewed and cooked. However, there are numerous examples of women who learned to hunt out of necessity and more recently as a personal choice.  The marital customs among the Inuit were not strictly monogamous, many Inuit relationships were implicitly or explicitly sexually open, and polygamy, divorce and remarriage were fairly common.  Formal marriage and divorce required the approval of the community, and particularly the agreement of the elders.  Marriages were often arranged, sometimes in infancy, and occasionally forced on the couple by the community.  Marriage was expected for a man as soon as he could hunt for himself, and for women at puberty.  Family structure was flexible - a household might consist of a man and his wife or wives and children; it might include his parents or his wife's parents as well as adopted children; or it might be a larger formation of several siblings with their parents, wives and children; or even more than one family sharing dwellings and resources.  Every household had a head of household - an elder or a particularly respected man.    There was also a larger notion of community, generally several families who shared a place where they wintered.  Goods were shared within a household, and to a lesser extent within a whole community in winter.  As with most nomadic people, there was no real conception of ownership of land - if a spot was unoccupied, all were free to hunt or camp there.  Animals belosefeaiia l  ooeia'epeldutrohoe

Generated seq by model:- ese notions (topological dimension, Hausdorff dimension, Minkowski-Bouligand dimension) all give the same value for many shapes. They give different values for some highly irregular curves. Those curves were originally called &quot;[[monster curve]]s&quot; because they seemed so bizarre and non-intuitive at the time. But [[BenoÃ®t Mandelbrot]] says that most shapes found in nature are best modeled by such irregular curves.  ==Formal definition==  The Hausdorff dimension gives an accurate way to measure the [[dimension]] of an arbitrary [[metric space]]; this includes complicated [[mathematical set|set]]s such as [[fractal]]s.   Suppose (''X'',''d'') is a metric space.  As mentioned in the introduction, we are interested in counting the number of balls of some radius  necessary to cover a given set.  It is possible to try to do this directly for many sets (leading to so-called box counting dimension), but Hausdorff's insight was to approach the problem indirectly using the theory of [[countably additive measure| measure]] developed earlier in the century by [[Henri Lebesgue]] and [[Constantin Caratheodory]].   In order to deal with the technical details of this approach, Hausdorff defined an entire family of measures on subsets of ''X'', one for each possible dimension ''s'' &amp;isin; &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,&amp;infin;)&lt;/nowiki&gt;. For example, if ''X''= '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, this construction assigns an ''s'' dimensional measure ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; to all subsets  of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; including the unit segment along the ''x''-axis [0,1] &amp;times; {0} &amp;times; {0}, the unit square on the ''x''-''y'' plane [0,1] &amp;times; [0,1] &amp;times; {0} and the unit cube [0,1] &amp;times; [0,1] &amp;times; [0,1].  For ''s'' = 2, one would expect  * &lt;math&gt; H^2([0,1] \times \{0\} \times \{0\}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;  * &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; H^2([0,1] \times [0,1] \times \{0\}) &lt; +\infty &lt;/math&gt;  * &lt;math&gt; H^2([0,1] \times [0,1] \times [0,1]) = +\infty &lt;/math&gt;  The above example suggests that we can define a set ''A'' to have Hausdorff dimension ''s'' if its ''s''-dimensional Hausdorff measure is positive and finite; in fact we have to modify this slightly.  The Hausdorff dimension of ''A'' is the cutoff value ''s'' where below ''s'' the ''s''-dimensional Hausdorff measure is &amp;infin; and above ''s'' it is 0. It is possible for the ''s'' dimensional Hausdorff measure of an ''s'' dimensional set to  be 0 or &amp;infin;. For instance '''R''' has dimension 1 and its 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure is infinite.  To carry this construction of this measure, we use a theory of measure which is appropriate for metric spaces.  Define a family of [[outer measure|metric outer measure]]s on ''X'' using the ''Method'' II construction of outer measures due to Munroe and described in the article [[outer measure]]. Let ''C'' be the class of all subsets of ''X''; for each positive [[real number]] ''s'', let ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; be the function ''A'' &amp;rarr; diam(''Aqeraum- er 0|teoouci [ewrtuy t

Thus, for example, after the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Mexican Revolution]] there was a distinct [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] tone in those countries that exists to this day. On a more extreme level, [[Karl Marx]] condemned religion as the &quot;[[opium of the people]]&quot; [http://www.baylor.edu/~Scott_Moore/texts/Marx_Opium.html] and the [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] governments of the twentieth century were generally atheistic; of these, only [[Albania]] officially declared itself to be an atheistic state. All of these Marxist governments repressed the exercise of religion in varying degrees.  == 20th century == Christianity in the 20th century was characterized by accelerating fragmentation. The century saw the rise of both liberal and conservative splinter groups, as well as a general secularization of Western society. The Roman Catholic Church instituted many reforms in order to modernize. Missionaries also made inroads in the [[Far East]], establishing further followings in [[China]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Japan]]. At the same time, persecution in Communist Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union brought many Eastern Orthodox Christians to Western Europe and the United States, leading to greatly increased contact between Western and Eastern Christianity.  In addition, [[Christian ecumenism]] grew in importance, beginning at the [[Edinburgh Missionary Conference]] in 1910.  ===Catholic reforms=== * [[Second Vatican Council]] * [[Christian ecumenism|Ecumenical initiatives]] ** Anathemas (excommunications) from the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] mutually revoked by the [[Pope]] and the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] ** [[Pope John Paul II]]  ===f mc  b{e,e -  ar e od[rS/ [i

He was elected again every year but one until the revolution replaced the assembly with a state Convention as an interim government.  The year he missed was [[1773]] when he visited England to arrange for his children's education.  He was named to the colony's Council in 1764 and 1768, but declined both times.  In [[1772]] he joined the [[American Philosophical Society]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], and carried on some extensive correspondence with other members.  As the [[American Revolution]] neared, Laurens first inclination was to support reconciliation with the [[United Kingdom|British Crown]].  But as conditions deteriorated he came to fully support the American position.  When Carolina began the creation of a revolutionary government, he was elected to the Provincial Congress which first met on [[January 9]], [[1775]].  He was president of the ''Committee of Safety'', and presiding officer of that congress from June until March of [[1776]].  When South Carolina installed a full independent government, he served as the Vice President of South Carolina from March of 1776 to [[June 27]], [[1777]].   Henry Laurens was first named a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] on [[January 10]], [[1777]].  He served in the Congress from then until [[1780]].  He was the [[President of the Continental Congress]] from [[November 1]], 1777 to [[December 9]], [[1778]].  In the fall of [[1779]] the Congress named Laurens their minister to [[Netherlands|Holland]].  In early [[1780]] he took up that post and successfully negotiated Dutch support for the war.  But on his return voyage that fall the British Navy intercepted his ship and discovered the draft of a possible U.S.-Dutch treaty prepared by [[William Lee]]. This treaty was used as a reason for war between Great Britain and the Netherlands. Laurens was charged with treason and imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].  This became another issue between the British and Americans.  In the field, most captives were regarded as prisoners of war, and while conditions were frequently appalling, prisoner exchanges and mail privileges were accepted practice.  Finally, on [[December 31]], [[1781]] he was released in exchange for General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]] and completed his voyage.  In [[1783]] Laurens was in [[Paris]] as one of the Peace Commissioners for the negotiations leading to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]].  While he didn't sign the primary treaty, he was instrumental in reaching the secondary accords that resolved issues involving the Netherlands and [[Spain]].  He generally retired from public life in 1784.  He was sought for a return to the Continental Congress, the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in [[1787]] and the state assembly, but he declined all of these jobs.

Generated seq by model:- s available to a single particle in a gas of like particles, where ''f'' represented the relative [[frequency distribution]] of each possible state.  Boltzmann argued mathematically that the effect of collisions between the particles would cause the ''H''-function to inevitably increase from any initial configuration until equilibrium was reached; and identified it as an underlying microscopic rationale for the macroscopic [[thermodynamic entropy]] of [[Clausius]].    (The ''H''-theorem of Boltzmann subsequently led to no end of controversy; and can still cause lively debates to the present day, often aggravated by protagonists not realising that they are arguing at cross-purposes.  The theorem relies on a hidden assumption, that useful information is destroyed by the collisions, which can be questioned; also, it relies on a non-equilibrium state being singled out as the initial state (not the final state), which breaks time symmetry; also, strictly it applies only in a statistical sense, namely that an average ''H''-function would be non-decreasing).  Boltzmann's definition was soon reworked by the American mathematical physicist [[J. Willard Gibbs]] into a general formula for the statistical-mechanical entropy, no longer requiring identical and non-interacting particles, but instead based on the probability distribution ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the complete microstate ''i'' of the total system:  : &lt;math&gt;S = -k_B \sum p_i \ln p_i \,&lt;/math&gt;  This (Gibbs) entropy from statistical mechanics can be found to directly correspond to the Clausius's classical thermodynamical definition, as explored further in the article: ''[[Thermodynamic entropy]]''.   Szilard, Lewis.  Shannon himself was apparently not particularly aware of the close similarity between his new quantity and the earlier work in thermodynamics; but [[John von Neumann]] was.  The story goes that when Shannon was deciding what to call his new quantity, fearing that 'information' was already over-used, von Neumann told him firmly: &quot;You should call it entropy, for two reasons. In the first place your uncertainty function has been used in statistical mechanics under that name, so it already has a name. In the second place, and more important, no one really knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage.&quot;  &lt;!-- remaining material still to be reworked   This work drew on earlier publications by .  At the beginning of his paper, Shannon asserted that  :&quot;The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point, either exactly or approximately, a message selected at another point.&quot;   His theory for the first time considered communication as a rigorously stated mathematical problem in [[statistics]] and gave communications engineers a way to determine the [[Shannon limit|capacity]] of a [[communication channel]] in terms of the common currency of [[bit]]s.  This problem is called the [[channel coding]] problem.  The transmission part of the theory is not concerned with the ni iei , 0 1 i  cd |h o/ cam&n

Generated seq by model:- e used to disambiguate the more modern style of such works, focusing on narrative, from the more traditional focus on [[puzzle]]s. More expansive definitions of interactive fiction may refer to all adventure games, including wholly graphical adventures such as ''[[Myst]]''.  Today, interactive fiction no longer appears to be commercially viable, but a constant stream of new works is produced by an online interactive fiction community, using freely available development systems. Most of these games can be downloaded for free from the Interactive Fiction Archive (see [[Interactive fiction#External links|external links]]).  Since [[1995]] there has been an annual [[Interactive Fiction Competition]] for relatively short works. There are also annual [[XYZZY Awards]] given out in various categories, modelled on the [[Academy Awards]]. Another annual competition, the [[Spring Thing]], has been held since [[2001]] to highlight works considered to be too long for the Interactive Fiction Competition.  == The medium of interactive fiction==  Text adventures are one of the oldest types of [[computer and video games|computer games]] and form a subset of the [[adventure game|adventure]] genre. The player uses text input to control the game and the game state is relayed to the player via text output.  Input is usually provided by the player in the form of simple [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s such as &quot;get key&quot; or &quot;go east&quot; which may be handled by a simple [[parsing|parser]]. Parsers vary in sophistication; the first text adventure parsers could only handle two-word sentences in the form of verb-noun pairs. Later parsers could handle increasing levels of complexity from sentences such as &quot;open the red box with the green key then go north&quot;. This level of complexity is the standard for works of interactive fiction today.  Works of interactive fiction function like single-player [[MUD|Multi-User Dungeons]] or 'MUDs', and the original MUD was actually a multi-player generalization of ''[[Zork]]'' (one version of which was called ''Dungeon''). MUDs, which became popular in the mid-[[1980s]], rely on a textual exchange and accept similar commands from players as do works of IF, but the social aspects and the communities of players who participate are often the most important features of MUDs.  Interactive fiction usually relies on [[reading (activity)|reading]] from a screen and on [[typing]] input, although speech synthesis allows blind and visually impaired users to play interactive fiction.  == History ==  ===''Adventure''=== Around [[1975]] [http://jerz.setonhill.edu/if/canon/Adventure.htm], [[Will Crowther]] wrote the first text adventure game, ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]'' (originally called ''ADVENT'' because a filename could only be six characters long in its [[operating system]], and later ''Colossal Cave'').

Generated seq by model:- ns of his list from time to time.  It began with a posting titled '''Those Eyes''', on the subject of [[actress]]es with beautiful eyes. [[Hank Driskill]] began to collect a list of sexy actresses and what movies they had appeared in, and as the size of the repeated posting grew far beyond a normal newsgroup article, it soon became known simply as '''THE LIST'''. {{ref|THE_LIST}}.  The other project, started by [[Chuck Musciano]], was briefly called the '''Movie Ratings List''' and soon became the '''Movie Ratings Report'''. Musciano simply asked readers to rate movies on a scale of 1 to 10, and reported on the votes {{ref|MRR}}.  He soon began posting &quot;ballots&quot; with lists of movies for people to rate, so his list also grew quickly.  In [[1990]] [[Col Needham]] collated the two lists and produced a '''Combined LIST &amp; Movie Ratings Report''' {{ref|Combined}}, and at this point the ball really started rolling. Needham soon found himself starting a (male) '''[[Actor]]s List''', while [[Dave Knight]] began a '''[[film director|Directors]] List''', and [[Andy Krieg]] took over THE LIST, which would later be renamed as the '''Actress List'''.  Both this and the Actors List had been restricted to people who were still alive and working, but retired people began to be added, and Needham also started what was then (but did not remain) a separate '''Dead Actors/Actresses List'''. The goal now was to make the lists as inclusive as the maintainers could manage.  In late [[1990]], the lists included almost 10,000 [[movies]] and [[television series]]. On [[October 17]], [[1990 in film|1990]], Needham posted a collection of [[Unix]] [[shell script]]s which could be used to search the four lists, and the database that would become the IMDb was born. At the time, it was known as the '''rec.arts.movies movie database'''.  ===On the Web===  By [[1993 in film|1993]], the database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material, as well as [[trivia]], [[biographies]], and [[plot|plot summaries]]; the movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data; and a centralised email interface for querying the database had been created. Later in the year, it moved onto to the [[World Wide Web]] (a network in its infancy back then) under the name of ''Cardiff Internet Movie Database''. The database resided on the [[servers]] of the computer science department of [[Cardiff University]] in [[Wales]]. [[Rob Hartill]] was the original web interface author. In [[1994 in film|1994]], the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information, meaning that people no longer had to email the specific list maintainer with their updates. However, the structure remained that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers, the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein.  Its management also continued to be in the hands of a small contingent of underpaid or voluudrd g ereavcetsiul] tnrmswrne

Generated seq by model:-  a dynasty of Grail keepers that eventually includes Perceval.  ===The Grail in other early literature=== After this point, Grail literature divides into two classes. The first concerns King Arthurâs knights visiting the Grail castle or questing after the object; the second concerns the Grailâs history in the time of Joseph of Arimathea.  The nine most important works from the first group are: * The ''Perceval'' of ChrÃ©tien de Troyes. * Four continuations of ChrÃ©tienâs poem, by authors of differing vision and talent, designed to bring the story to a close. * The German ''[[Parzival]]'' by [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], which adapted at least the holiness of Robertâs Grail into the framework of ChrÃ©tienâs story. * The Didot ''Perceval'', named after the manuscriptâs former owner, and purportedly a prosification of Robert de Boronâs sequel to ''Joseph dâArimathie''. * The [[Welsh romance]] ''[[Peredur]]'' (generally included in the ''[[Mabinogion]]''), based on ChrÃ©tienâs poem but including very striking differences from it. * ''[[Perlesvaus]]'', called the &quot;least canonical&quot; Grail romance because of its very different character. * The German ''[[Diu CrÃ´ne]]'' (''The Crown''), in which Gawain, rather than Perceval, achieves the Grail. * The ''[[Lancelot]]'' section of the vast [[Vulgate Cycle]], which introduces the new Grail hero, [[Galahad]]. * The ''[[Queste del Saint Graal]]'', another part of the Vulgate Cycle, concerning the adventures of Galahad and his achievement of the Grail.  Of the second class there are: * Robert de Boronâs ''Joseph dâArimathie'', * The ''Estoire del Saint Graal'', the first part of the Vulgate Cycle (but written after ''Lancelot'' and the ''Queste''), based on Robertâs tale but expanding it greatly with many new details.  Though all these works have their roots in ChrÃ©tien, several contain pieces of tradition not found in ChrÃ©tien which are possibly derived from earlier sources.  ==Ideas of the Grail== [[Image:Galahad_grail.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Galahad]], [[Bors]], and [[Percival]] achieve the Grail]] As stated above, the Grail was considered a bowl or dish when first described by ChrÃ©tien de Troyes. Other authors had their own ideas; Robert de Boron portrayed it as the vessel of the Last Supper, and ''Peredur'' had no Grail per se, presenting the hero instead with a platter containing his kinsman's bloody, severed head. In ''Parzival'', Wolfram von Eschenbach, citing the authority of a certain (probably fictional) [[Kyot the ProvenÃ§al]], claimed the Grail was a stone that fell from Heaven, and had been the sanctuary of the Neutral Angels who took neither side during [[Lucifer]]'s rebellion. The authors of the Vulgate Cycle used the Grail as a symbol of [[divine grace]]. Galahad, bastard son of the world's greatest knight, [[Lancelot]], and the Grail Bearer [[Elaine (legend)|Elaine]], is destined to achieve the Grail, his spiritual purity making him a better warrior than even his illustrious father.

A final risk factor is any condition (temporary or permanent) which impairs one's judgement, such as excess [[alcohol]] or [[drugs]], or emotional states such as [[loneliness]], [[depression]] or [[euphoria]] (eg new students at college), because these may raise the risk of any of the above. Carefully considered activity can greatly reduce all of these issues.  === Sexually transmitted disease === Sexual behaviors that involve contact with another person or the bodily fluids of another person entail some risk of transmission of [[sexually transmitted infections]], which is why [[safer sex]] techniques are recommended.  These techniques are generally seen as less necessary for those in committed monogamous relationships with persons who have been demonstrated to be free of disease; see [[fluid bonding]].  Due to [[health]] concerns arising from [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[chlamydia]], [[syphilis]], [[gonorrhea]] and other [[sexually-transmitted infections]], some people may want potential [[sex]] partners be tested for [[Sexually-transmitted infection|STI]]s before engaging in [[sex]].  ===Unwanted pregnancy=== Sexual behaviors that involve the contact of [[semen]] with the [[vagina]] or [[vulva]] may result in [[pregnancy]].  To prevent pregnancy, many people employ a variety of [[birth control]] measures. The most popular methods of prevention are condoms, spermicides, and the birth control pill.  === Judgement impairment === [[Recreational drug use|Recreational drugs]] are often used in social settings in the belief that they enhance interpersonal communication.  Some common recreational drugs are [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[caffeine]] and [[nicotine]].    * [[Alcoholic beverage|Alcohol]] is sometimes called a &quot;social lubricant&quot; because it reduces [[Social_Inhibition|inhibitions]], including those caused by the fear of rejection.  At the same time, though, alcohol impairs judgment, making a person less receptive to subtle signals, which can result in less effective communication.  More importantly, this judgement impairment can lead to poor decision-making regarding sex, such as engaging in [[unsafe sex]]. * [[Cannabis (drug)|Cannabis]] can induce increased appreciation for [[humour]] and [[art]], which might improve communication.  But at the same time, it can cause one to become [[Introspection|introspective]], and thus less inclined to communicate.  * [[Caffeine]] and [[nicotine]] are [[stimulant]]s. Others include [[amphetamine]]s and [[cocaine]]. Stimulants can increase alertness and improve [[attention]], both of which can improve one's ability to communicate effectively. However, stimulants also have adverse health effects when used in large amounts.  Use of recreational drugs is frequently cited as a risk factor for health problems including [[sexually transmitted diseases]], [[addiction]], [[birth defects]], [[heart disease]], [[cancer]] and [[liver disease]], among others.[http://dancesafe.org/documents/druginfo/rig nn ' o oscn,oe igen nnydup[

James complained how the burden of caring for their drunken mother fell to him over the many years Hunter was away, including sometimes having to take a taxi to pick her up off the pavement where she had passed out.   Hunter married Anita Bejmuk, his long-time assistant, on [[24 April]], [[2003]].  ==Death== Thompson died at his fortified compound in [[Woody Creek, Colorado|Woody Creek]], [[Colorado]], at 5:42 pm on [[February 20]], [[2005]] from a [[suicide|self-inflicted]] gunshot wound to the head.  He was 67 years old.  Thompson's son (Juan), daughter-in-law (Jennifer Winkel Thompson), and grandson (Will Thompson) were visiting for the weekend at the time of his suicide. Will and Jennifer were in the adjacent room when they heard the gunshot. They reported to the press that they do not believe his suicide was out of desperation, but was a well thought out act resulting from Thompson's many painful medical conditions.{{fn|2}}  Thompson's wife, Anita, who was at the gym at the time of her husband's death, was on the phone with Thompson when he ended his life.  Artist and friend [[Ralph Steadman]] wrote:  :&quot;...He told me 25 years ago that he would feel real trapped if he didn't know that he could commit suicide at any moment.  I don't know if that is brave or stupid or what, but it was inevitable. I think that the truth of what rings through all his writing is that he meant what he said. If that is entertainment to you, well, that's OK. If you think that it enlightened you, well, that's even better. If you wonder if he's gone to Heaven or Hell &amp;mdash;rest assured he will check out them both, find out which one Richard Milhous Nixon went to &amp;mdash;and go there. He could never stand being bored. But there must be Football too &amp;mdash;and Peacocks...&quot; {{fn|3}}  Three months later, ''Rolling Stone'' released what was claimed to be Thompson's final written words, written with a marker four days before his death, The title was &quot;Football Season is over&quot;: :&quot;No More Games. No More Bombs. No More Walking. No More Fun. No More Swimming. 67. That is 17 years past 50. 17 more than I needed or wanted. Boring. I am always bitchy. No Fun&amp;mdash;for anybody. 67. You are getting Greedy. Act your old age. Relax&amp;mdash;This won't hurt.&quot;  ===Funeral=== On [[August 20]], [[2005]], in a private ceremony, Thompson's ashes were fired from a cannon atop a 153-foot tower of his own design (in the shape of a double-thumbed fist clutching a [[peyote]] button) to the tune of [[Bob Dylan]]'s &quot;[[Mr. Tambourine Man]],&quot; known to be the song most-respected by the late writer. Red, white, blue and green fireworks were launched along with his ashes.  As the city of Aspen would not allow the cannon to remain for more than a month, the cannon has been dismantled and put into storage until a suitable permanent location can be found.

Generated seq by model:- ions engineers a way to determine the [[Shannon limit|capacity]] of a [[communication channel]] in terms of the common currency of [[bit]]s.  This problem is called the [[channel coding]] problem.  The transmission part of the theory is not concerned with the [[meaning]] ([[semantics]]) of the message conveyed.     Several early notions of [[information entropy]] predated Shannon's paper.  One version was defined and used during the Second World War by [[Alan Turing]] at [[Bletchley Park]].  Turing named it &quot;weight of evidence&quot; and measured it in units called [[ban (information)|bans]] and [[deciban]]s. (This is not to be confused with the ''weight of evidence'' defined by [[I.J. Good]] and described in the article [[statistical inference]], which Turing also tackled and named &quot;log-odds&quot; or &quot;lods&quot;.) Turing and Shannon collaborated during the war but it appears that they independently created the concept.  A very similar concept was developed by Boltzmann during the 1800's in his work on [[statistical mechanics]].    This connection, between information-theoretic entropy and thermodynamic entropy, was later studied by [[Rolf Landauer]] and is described in this article.  --&gt;  === Development since 1948 === {{section stub}}  ==References== ===The classic paper=== * [[Claude Elwood Shannon|Shannon, C.E.]] (1948), &quot;[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]&quot;, ''Bell System Technical Journal'', 27, pp. 379â423 &amp; 623â656, July &amp; October, 1948.

Generated seq by model:- l numbers in the 1850s. Earlier predictions expected that by 1851, Ireland would have a population of 8 to 9 million. This calculation is based on numbers contained in the ten year census results compiled since 1821. (However, a recent re-examination of those returns raise questions as to their accuracy; the 1841 Census, for example, incorrectly classed farm children as labourers, affecting later calculations on how many adults capable of child-bearing existed to produce children between 1841 and 1851!). What we do know is that in 1851 the actual population was 6.6 million. Making straightforward calculations is complicated by a secondary effect of famine, a key side-effect of malnutrition, namely plummeting fertility and sexual activity rates. The scale of that effect on population numbers was not fully recognised until studies done during [[Africa]]n famines in the twentieth century. As a result, corrections based on inaccuracies in census returns and on the previous unrealised decline in births due to malnourishment have led to an overall reduction in the presumed death numbers. Modern historians and statisticians estimate that between 500,000 and 1,100,000 died. Many historians suggest the death-toll was in the region of 700,000 to 800,000.{{fn|2}} One website claims a figure of over five million though most historians have dismissed this claim and the reliability of its calculations. [http://www.catholicapologetics.net/Ireland's%20Holocaust.htm] In addition, in excess of one million Irish emigrated in the notorious [[coffin ship|coffin ships]] to the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and elsewhere, while more than one million emigrated over following decades; by 1911, a combination of emigration and an abnormally high number of unmarried men and women in the population, had reduced the population of Ireland to 4.4 million.   The initial British government response towards the early famine was, in the view of historians such as [[F.S.L. Lyons]] 'prompt and relatively successful'.{{fn|3}} Professor Joe Lee contended: :there was nothing unique, by the standards of pre-industrial subsistence crisis, about the [Irish] famine. The death rate had been frequently equalled in earlier European famines, including, possibly, in Ireland itself during the famine of [[Irish Famine of 1740-41|1740-41]].{{fn|4}}  In the case of the 1846-49 Irish Famine, with tragic consequences the [[Tory]] government of Sir [[Robert Peel]] (who had served in the [[Dublin Castle]] British administration, having begun his political career as an MP for a [[rotten borough]] of [[Cashel]], [[County Tipperary]] and so had some understanding of Ireland) was replaced (with the help of Irish MPs under [[Daniel O'Connell]]) by a Whig ministry under [[Lord John Russell]]. Russell believed in a [[laissez-faire]] economic policy of non-intervention in the economy. So whereas Peel had imported Indian [[maize]] to feed the starving, Russell instead focused on providing support through public works and [[work-houses]]. A disastrosd taoelosnle resi h be arutyn

The Braves were fifth place on [[August 19]], but outplayed the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] and [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]] down the stretch to win the division.  Aaron slugged 44 homers and knocked in 97 runs.  The Braves lost to the Miracle [[New York Mets|Mets]] in the playoffs, three games to none.  Aaron and brother [[Tommie Aaron|Tommie]] were the first siblings to appear in a League Championship series together as teammates.  Aaron finished 3rd in MVP voting.  Aaron got his 3,000th career hit off of [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]]' [[Wayne Simpson]] on [[May 17]], [[1970 in sports|1970]] with a single in the second game of a doubleheader at Cincinnati's Crosley Field, becoming the first player to reach that milestone and hit 500 career home runs.  On [[July 31]], he hit a home run against [[Dave Guisti]] of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]] in Atlanta for this 30th homer of the season, establishing a National League record for most seasons with 30 or more homers (12).  [[1971 in sports|1971]] saw several milestones for Aaron.  On [[April 27]] he hit his 600th career homer off the [[San Francisco Giants]]' [[Gaylord Perry]] in [[Atlanta]].  The greatest home run hitter slugged two homers off the greatest [[strikeout]] [[pitcher]], [[Nolan Ryan]], the first of which was on [[May 21]], [[1971 in sports|1971]], in [[Shea Stadium]].  On [[July 31]] Aaron homered in an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] for the first time, connecting off [[Vida Blue]] in [[Detroit]].  He hit his 40th home run of the season against the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]]' [[Jerry Johnson]] on [[August 10]], establishing a National League record for most seasons with 40 or more home runs (seven).  On [[September 21]], Aaron homered against the [[San Diego Padres|Padres]]' [[Jay Franklin]] for his 46th home run of the season &amp;ndash; a new career high.  Five days later, he hit his 47th home run, the most he hit in a season. He finished 3rd in MVP voting for the 6th time in his career.  During the strike shortened season of [[1972 in sports|1972]], Aaron tied and then surpassed [[Willie Mays]] for second place on the career home run list with home runs on [[May 31]] (648) off of the [[San Diego Padres|Padres]]' [[Fred Norman]] and [[June 10]] (649) off of the [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]]' [[Wayne Twitchell]].  His home run on [[June 10]] was also his 14th grand slam, tying him with [[Willie McCovey]] and [[Gil Hodges]] for the National League record.  On [[June 28]] Aaron hit a two-run homer to tie [[Lou Gehrig]] for second place on the all-time RBI list with 1,990.  The next day he passes Gehrig with a home run off of the [[San Diego Padres|Padres]]' [[Mike Caldwell]] to move into sole possession of second place on the all-time RBI list.

The state's official name is '''Ireland''' (Irish: ''[[Ãire]]''), and this is how international organisations and citizens of Ireland usually refer to the country. It is a member of the [[European Union]], has a [[developed country|developed economy]] and a population of slightly more than four million. The remaining sixth of the island of Ireland is known as [[Northern Ireland]] and is part of the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].  ==Name== ''Main article: [[Names of the Irish state]]''  The constitution provides that the name of the state is &quot;Ãire, or, in the [[English language]], Ireland.&quot; However, the [[state]] is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot;, in order to distinguish it from the island of Ireland. The name ''Republic of Ireland'' came into use after the [[Republic of Ireland Act]] defined it as the official description of the state in [[1949]] (the purpose of the act being to declare that the state was a [[republic]] rather than a form of [[constitutional monarchy]]). It is also the accepted legal name of the state in the [[United Kingdom]] as per the [[Ireland Act 1949]]. Today, while ''Republic of Ireland'' is a valid term for the state, ''Ireland'' is used for official purposes such as treaties, government and legal documents, and membership of international organisations.  The state is also known by, in English, many other names, such as ''[[Ãire]]'', ''The Free State'' and the ''Twenty-six Counties''. The use of Ãire when speaking English in Ireland has become increasingly rare, not least due to historical condescending connotations.  The state has had more than one official title. The revolutionary state established by nationalists in [[1919]] was known as the &quot;[[Irish Republic]]&quot;; when the state achieved ''de jure'' independence in [[1922]], it became known as the &quot;[[Irish Free State]]&quot; (in the [[Irish language]] ''SaorstÃ¡t Ãireann''), a name that was retained until [[1937]].  ==History== ''Main article: [[History of the Republic of Ireland]]''  The partition of Ireland came about because of complex constitutional developments in the early twentieth century.  From [[1 January]] [[1801]] until [[6 December]] [[1922]], Ireland was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. During the [[Irish Potato Famine|Great Potato Famine]] in 1845-1849 the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30%. 1 million Irish died of starvation, another 1.5 million were forced to emigrate, which set the emigration pattern for the century to come and would resurnrwdldlspdo lseca1dw etas1 ti

When they are accustomed to being handled and are not startled, however, they are not inclined to bite and can be placed in the custody of responsible school-age children. Like many rodents, their teeth grow continuously and they must have appropriate things to chew on to relieve their instinctive gnawing and to help keep the teeth at a healthy length.  They will gnaw on whatever is available, so they must be kept in enclosures that they cannot chew through. When the hamster is kept in or near a bedroom, their nocturnal nature combined with their gnawing  habit can become  distracting.  ===Exercise and Entertainment=== [[Image:000_0580.JPG|thumb|A hamster ball]] Like all pets, hamsters need exercise and entertainment to maintain their physical and mental health.  An exercise wheel allows hamsters to run full speed to their hearts' content, and is a must. As more elaborate enclosures including additional toys such as plastic or wooden tubes that somewhat mimic the burrows that they might have in the wild and allow their owners to enjoy their activities.  Most commercial exercise wheels marketed for hamsters have rungs which are not suitable for hamsters due to the fact that a hamster could get injured in one.  Clear plastic hamster balls or cars are available, into which the hamster is placed and then, by its own action, explores an entire house or yard.  Use these toys ''only'' under supervision and use common sense. Unsupervised hamsters in these toys can become trapped against furniture and panic or they can roll down stairs, injuring themselves.  Do not leave them in these toys for extended periods, especially on warm days, and make sure to remove them frequently and allow them access to water or fresh fruits or vegetables.  Toys should always ''invite'' the hamster to explore and use them at its own will, without forcing or violence. They should only be left in a hamster ball for 10-15 minutes at the most or they can dehydrate.  If they are handled frequently, hamsters enjoy being out of their enclosures and having the opportunity to explore. They can also become very tame if handled frequently. Syrian hamsters will be tame for life once they are tamed, but if neglected, dwarf hamsters will become mean and will bite.  However, they must be kept away from holes in the wall or in large pieces of furniture, because they will seek out the dark and burrow-like confines of those areas and it can be difficult or impossible to convince them to come out again.  ===Food=== Pet stores can provide basic food for hamsters that provides their nutritional needs, but they also enjoy fresh [[vegetable]]s and [[fruit]]s, bird seed, and even living [[insect]]s, which make up an important part of their natural diet. However, not all foods are suitable for hamsters and some , such as sweets made for humans or poisonous plants like the ''leaves'' of the [[tomato]], may be most dangerous for the hamster's health.

After VOC was dissolved in 1799 by the [[Batavian Republic]] ([[Napoleon_I_of_France|Napoleon's]] Dutch satellite state) and the political instability from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] including partial British occupation, the East Indies were awarded to the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815. Since then, the East Indies were officially ruled as the major colonies of the Dutch crown.  Under the 19th-century [[Cultivation System]] (''Cultuurstelsel''), large plantations and forced cultivation were established on Java, finally creating the profit for the Netherlands that the VOC had been unable to produce. In a more liberal period of colonial rule after 1870, the Cultivation System was abolished, and after 1901 the Dutch introduced the Ethical Policy, which included limited political reform and increased investment in the colony.  During [[World War II]], with the Netherlands under [[Germany|German]] [[Military occupation|occupation]], [[Japan]] began a five-prong campaign in December 1941 towards Java and the vital fuel supplies of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Though Japan captured Java by March 1942, it initially could not find any national leader willing to collaborate with the Japanese government against the Dutch. Eventually the Japanese commander ordered [[Sukarno]]'s  release from his prison island, and in July 1942, Sukarno arrived in Jakarta. Sukarno and his colleagues collaborated with the Japanese occupiers. In 1945, with the war drawing to a close, Sukarno was made aware of an opportunity to declare independence. In response to lobbying, Japan agreed to allow [[Sukarno]] to establish a committee to plan for independence. Sukarno and [[Mohammad Hatta]] declared independence on [[17 August]].  Following the defeat of Japan in the World War, the [[Royal Netherlands Army|Netherlands' Army]], at first backed by the [[British]], attempted to reoccupy their former East Indies colonies. Indonesia's war for independence lasted from 1945 until [[27 December]], [[1949]] when, under heavy international pressure, especially from the [[United States]], which threatened to cut off [[Marshall Plan]] funds, the Netherlands acknowledged the independence of Indonesia as a Federation of autonomous states. This federation soon became a republic with Sukarno as president and Hatta as vice president. ''See [[Indonesian National Revolution]]''. It was not until [[16 august]] [[2005]] that the Dutch [[government]] recognised 1945 as the country's year of independence and expressed regrets over the Indonesian deaths caused by the Netherlands' Army.  The 1950s and 1960s saw Sukarno's government aligned first with the emerging [[non-aligned movement]] and later with the [[socialist]] bloc.  The 1960s saw Indonesia in a military [[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|confrontation]] against neighboring [[Malaysia]], and increasing frustration over domestic economic difficulties.

Also, the temperatures required for D + &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He fusion are much higher than those of conventional D + T fusion, so it is unlikely that this type of fusion will be achieved before the problems with conventional fusion are worked out.  ==Cryogenics== Helium-3 is used in [[cryogenics]] to achieve temperatures as low as a few thousandths of a [[Kelvin]]; it was discovered by the Australian nuclear physicist [[Mark Oliphant]] while based at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]].  An important property of helium-3, which distinguishes it from the more common helium-4, is that its nucleus is a [[fermion]] since it contains an odd number of particles. At low temperatures (around 4.2K), helium-4 undergoes a [[phase transition]] into a [[superfluid]] [[phase (matter)|phase]] that can be roughly understood as a type of [[Bose-Einstein condensate | Bose Einstein condensation]]. Such a mechanism is not available for helium-3 atoms, which are fermions. However, it was widely speculated that helium-3 could also become a superfluid at much lower temperatures, if the atoms formed up into ''pairs'' analogous to the [[Cooper pair]]s in the [[BCS theory]] of [[superconductivity]]. During the [[1970s]], [[David Morris Lee]], [[Douglas Osheroff]], and [[Robert Coleman Richardson]] showed that helium-3 indeed becomes a superfluid at around 2 millikelvins. They were awarded the [[1996]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their discovery. [[Anthony James Leggett|Tony Leggett]] won the [[2003]] Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on refining our understanding of the superfluid phase of helium-3.  == Lunar supplies ==  The possibility that helium-3 may be widely found on the Moon has led to discussions ([http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/27/1931205&amp;from=rss], [http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,17943650-23109,00.html]) as to whether it could be used as an energy source. Yet to be determined is the exact quantity of helium-3 which the solar wind traps and deposits on the lunar surface.  It may be so scarce as to be beneath the point of economic recovery.  The ignition temperature for helium-3 is ten times higher than conventional fusion, which itself has yet to be achieved at the break-even point.  Accordingly, helium-3 seems less likely than other reactants for use in fusion power generation, though possibly not over the long term.   {{Isotope|element=[[Helium]] |lighter=[[Diproton]] |heavier=[[Helium-4]] |before=[[Hydrogen-3]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Lithium-4]] |after=Stable }}  ==External links== *[http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/helium3_000630.html Moon's Helium-3 Could Power Earth] *[http://www.mines.edu/research/srr/2001abstracts/vancleve.PDF Helium-3 Mining Aerostats in the Atmosphere of Uranus (pdf)] *[http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/2003/presentation-speech.html The Nobel Prize in Physics 2003, presentation speech]  *[http://ltl.tkk.fi/research/theory/he3.html Superfluid Helium-3]   [[Category:Isotopes]]  [[Category:Fueletprsrlnnrn nslfrtronr nlf l i

The law &quot;You shall not cut yourselves&quot; () is interpreted by the Rabbis: &quot;You shall not form divisions, but shall form one bond.&quot; (Source: [[Midrash]] Sifre on Deuteronomy 96)  Besides the term &quot;min&quot; for &quot;heretic,&quot; the [[Talmud]] uses the words &quot;Hitsonim&quot; (outsiders), &quot;[[apikoros]],&quot; and &quot;kofer ba-Torah&quot; (R. H. 17a), or &quot;kofer ba-'ikar&quot; (he who denies the fundamentals of faith; Pes. xxiv. 168b); also &quot;poresh mi-darke tsibbur&quot; (he who deviates from the customs of the community; Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 5; R.

Of all these it is said that they are consigned to Gehinnom for all eternity (Tosef., Sanh. l.c.; comp. ib. xii. 9, apparently belonging to xiii. 5: &quot;He who casts off the yoke [of the Law], and he who severs the Abrahamic covenant; he who interprets the Torah against the halakic tradition, and he who pronounces in full the Ineffable Nameâall these have no share in the world to come&quot;).  The [[Mishnah]] says the following have no share in the world to come: &quot;He who denies that the Torah is divinely revealed, and the apiá¸³oros.&quot; R. Akiba says, &quot;also he who reads heretical books&quot;. This is explained in the Talmud (Sanh. 100b) to mean &quot;sifre áºeduá¸³im&quot; (Sadducean writings); but this is an alteration by the censor of &quot;sifre ha-Minim&quot; (books of the Gnostics or Heretics). The Biblical version, &quot;That ye seek not after your own heart&quot; (Num. xv. 39), is explained (Sifre, Num. 115; Ber. 12b) as &quot;Ye shall not turn to heretic views [&quot;minut&quot;] which lead your heart away from God&quot; (see Maimonides, &quot;Yad,&quot; 'Akkum, ii. 3).  In summarizing the Talmudic statements concerning heretics in Sanh. 90-103, Maimonides (&quot;Yad,&quot; Teshubah, iii. 6-8) says:  &quot;The following have no share in the world to come, but are cut off, and perish, and receive their punishment for all time for their great sin: the minim, the apiá¸³oresim, they that deny the belief in the Torah, they that deny the belief in resurrection of the dead and in the coming of the Redeemer, the apostates, they that lead many to sin, they that turn away from the ways of the [Jewish] community. Five are called 'minim': (1) he who says there is no God and the world has no leader; (2) he who says the world has more than one leader; (3) he who ascribes to the Lord of the Universe a body and a figure; (4) he who says that God was not alone and Creator of all things at the world's beginning; (5) he who worships some star or constellation as an intermediating power between himself and the Lord of the World.  &quot;The following three classes are called 'apiá¸³oresim': (1) he who says there was no prophecy nor was there any wiuhieo]ltteei aglthilot e[raoyd

Generated seq by model:- scaped occupation.  The impact of the Mongol invasion on the territories of Kievan Rus' was uneven. About half of Russian population was lost during the invasion. The advanced city culture practically has been completely destroyed. Centers such as Kiev never recovered from the devastation of the initial attack. As Novgorod continued to prosper, a new entity, the city of Moscow, began to flourish under the Mongols since 1328. Although a Russian army defeated the Golden Horde at Kulikovo in 1380, Mongol domination of the Russian-inhabited territories, along with demands of tribute from Russian princes, continued until about 1480.  ===Golden Horde=== [[Image:Alexnev.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|Alexander Nevsky]] ''Main article: [[Golden Horde]]'' The Mongols dominated Russia from their western capital at [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]] on the [[Volga River]], near the modern city of [[Volgograd]]. The princes of southern and eastern Russia had to pay tribute to the Mongols, commonly called [[Tatars]], or the Golden Horde; but in return they received charters authorizing them to act as deputies to the khans. In general, the princes were allowed considerable freedom to rule as they wished. One of them, [[Alexander Nevsky]], prince of [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Vladimir]], acquired heroic status in the mid-13th century as the result of major victories over the [[Teutonic Knights]], the [[Swedes]] and the [[Lithuanians]]. To the Orthodox Church and most princes, the westerners seemed a greater threat to the Russian way of life than the Mongols. Nevsky obtained Mongol protection and assistance in fighting invaders from the west who, hoping to profit from the Russian collapse since the Mongol invasions, tried to grab territory. Even so, Nevsky's successors would later come to challenge Tartar rule.   Nevertheless Mongol invasions of Russian principalities proceeded during all periods of the Golden Horde rule and caused frequent devastations.  The Mongols left their impact on the Russians in such areas as military tactics and the development of trade routes. Under Mongol occupation, Muscovy also developed its postal road network, census, fiscal system, and military organization. Eastern influence remained strong well until the 18th century, when Russian rulers made a conscious effort to Westernize their country.  ==Muscovy== ''Main article: [[Muscovy]]'' ===The rise of Moscow=== [[Daniil Aleksandrovich]], the youngest son of Nevski, founded the principality of Muscovy based in the city of Moscow, which eventually expelled the Tartars from Russia. Well-situated in the central river system of Russia and surrounded by protective forests and marshes, Muscovy was at first only a [[vassal]] of Vladimir, but soon it absorbed its parent state. A major factor in the ascendancy of Muscovy was the cooperation of its rulers with the Mongol overlords, who granted them the title of Grand Prince of Russia and made them agents for collecting the Tartar tribute from the Russian principalities. The principality's prestige was further enhanced when it became the cene[u iv iodut] nrotmetohsee   e

Generated seq by model:- 913]], by using [[x-ray]] [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] obtained by [[diffraction]] in [[crystal]]s, he found a systematic relation between [[wavelength]] and [[atomic number]], [[Moseley's law]]. Previous to this, atomic numbers had been thought of as an arbitrary number, based on sequence of [[atomic weight]]s, but altered when necessary (for example, by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]) to put an [[chemical element|element]] in the appropriate place in the [[periodic table]]. Moseley's discovery showed that atomic numbers were not arbitrary but had an experimentally measurable basis. In addition, Moseley showed that there were gaps in the sequence at numbers 43, 61 and 75 (now known to be radioactive, non-naturally-occurring, [[technetium]] and [[promethium]], and the last discovered naturally-occurring element [[rhenium]], respectively). Mendeleev had previously predicted [[technetium]], and [[Bohuslav Brauner]] had previously predicted promethium; Moseley confirmed their predictions, predicted one additional undiscovered element, and showed there were no other gaps in the periodic table between aluminum and gold.  In [[1914]] he resigned at Manchester to return to Oxford to pursue his research, but when World War I broke out, he turned down a job offer and enlisted in the [[Royal Engineers]]. He fought at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]], where he was killed in action by a sniper in 1915. Many have since speculated that he could have won the Nobel Prize, but was unable to because it is only awarded to the living.  Only twenty-seven years old at death, Moseley could in many scientists' opinions have contributed much to the knowledge of atomic structure had he lived. It is speculated that because of Moseley's death in the War that the British government no longer allowed their scientists to enlist in combat.  ==Further reading== *[[John L. Heilbron]], ''H.G. J.

This last approach is considered to be promising by some in the homeopathic community, because it allows for grouping remedies and classifying the ever-burgeoning Materia Medica, but is rejected by many purists because it involves speculation about remedy action without proper provings.  ''See also'': [[List of common homeopathic remedies]]  === The &quot;Theory of Infinitesimals&quot; === The most characteristic&amp;mdash;and controversial&amp;mdash;principle of homeopathy is that the potency of a remedy can be enhanced (and the side-effects diminished) by dilution, in a procedure known as ''dynamization'' or ''potentization''. Liquids are successively diluted (with water, or alcohol for water-insoluble materials) and shaken by ten hard strikes against an elastic body (''succussion''). Insoluble solids are diluted by grinding them with [[lactose]] (''[[trituration]]''). Higher dilutions are considered to be stronger 'deep-acting' remedies.   The dilution factor at each stage is traditionally 1:10 (&quot;D&quot; or &quot;X&quot; potencies) or 1:100 (&quot;C&quot; potencies). Hahnemann advocated 30C dilutions for most purposes, i.e. dilution by a factor of 100&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;.  As [[Avogadro's number]] is only 6.022 Ã 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; particles/mole, the chance of even one molecule of the original substance being present in a 15C solution is small, and it is extremely unlikely that one molecule would be present in a 30C solution. Thus homeopathic remedies that have a high &quot;potency&quot; essentially contain just water, but this water is believed by practitioners of homeopathy to retain some &quot;essential property&quot; of the substance once present.   A key criticism is that any water will, at some time in its history, have been in contact with many different substances. Thus, any drink may be considered to be an extreme dilution of almost any agent you care to mention. Thus, critics argue that almost everyone is almost always receiving homeopathic treatment for almost every condition. Proponents of homeopathy respond that the methodical dilution of a particular substance, beginning with a 10% solution and working downward, is different; exactly why this is different is not clear.   Later homeopaths advocated very high potencies, which could not be made by traditional methods, but required succussion without dilution (Jenichen), higher dilution factors (LM potencies are diluted by a factor of 50,000), or machines which integrate dilution and succussion into a continuous process (Korsakoff). The practitioner's choice of what potency is appropriate is subjective; it involves his or her opinion of how &quot;deep-seated&quot; the disease is; whether it is primarily physical or more mental/emotional; the patient's sensitivity based on the pra ni a ch d['s],cca[oogitbon ei

However, Morse also has qualities that make him different from Mycroft and therefore allow him to be a believable detective. His penchant for drinking, his life filled with difficult personal relationships, and his negligence with his health, however, make him a more tragic character than previous classic sleuths.  John Thaw portrayed these characteristics of Morse with superb skill; however, this may have been in part to the alcoholism that plagued his later life, up to one year before his death.  ===List=== The titles of the television episodes are: * 1st Series, [[1987]]: ** 1.

Neighbouring states are [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]] to the north, [[Rajasthan]] to the west and south. The river [[Yamuna]] acts as the eastern boundary between Haryana and the states of [[Uttaranchal]] &amp; [[Uttar Pradesh]].  Seasonal rivers like [[Ghaggar River]], Markanda, Tangri, Sahibi etc pass through the state.  == Geography == Haryana is situated in the north between 27 deg 37' to 30 deg 35' latitude and between 74 deg 28' to 77 deg 36' longitude. The altitude of Haryana varies between 700 to 3600 ft (200 metres to 2 kilometres) above sea level. The state is divided into four divisions for administrative purpose  - Ambala, Rohtak, Gurgaon and Hissar. There are 19 districts, 47 sub-divisions, 67 tehsils, 45 sub-tehsils and 116 blocks. Haryana has a total of 81 cities and towns. It has 6,759 villages.  An area of 1,553 km&amp;sup2; is covered by forest. Haryana has four main geographical features. * Shivalik Hills * [[Yamuna]] - Ghaggar (Saraswati) plain * Semi-desert sandy plain * [[Aravalli Range]]  == History == The mostly [[Hindi]]-speaking eastern portion of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] became Haryana, while mostly [[Punjabi]]-speaking western portion remained as Punjab. Today, Haryana has the vast majority of the ethnic [[Hindu]] population. [[Chandigarh]], on the linguistic border, was made a [[union territory]], that serves as capital of both these states. [[Chandigarh]] was due to transfer to Punjab alone in 1986, but the transfer was delayed by the Congress party due to presure from Hindu population.  Haryana, with more than 5000 year old history, is the cradle of [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] and [[Hindu]] civilization. It was here 5000 years ago that Lord [[Krishna]] preached [[Gita]] at the start of the battle of [[Mahabharata]]. Before the Mahabharata war, a battle of ten kings took place in the [[Kurukshetra]] region in the Saraswati valley. Mahabharata (3102 BC) mentions Haryana as Bahudhhanyaka, 'land of plentiful grains' and Bahudhana, 'land of immense riches'. The word 'Hariana' occurs in a [[Sanskrit]] inscription dated 1328 AD kept in Delhi Museum which refers to this region as &quot;The heaven on earth&quot;. It was here that the [[Aryan]] culture took birth and matured.  Excavations in places like Naurangabad, and Mittathal in Bhiwani, Kunal in Fatehbad, Agroha near Hissar, [[Rakhigarhi]] in Jind, Rukhi in Rohtak and [[Banawali]] in Sirsa have unearthed evidence of pre-Harappan and Harappan culture. Findings of pottery, sculpture and jewellery in sites at [[Kurukshetra]], Pehowa, Tilpat and Panipat have proved the historicity of the Mahabharat war. These places are mentioned in the Mahabharat as Prithudaka (Pehowa), Tilprastha (Tilput), Panprastha (Panipat) &amp; Sonprastha (Sonipat).  Haryana state came into existence on 1st November, 1966.  == Demographics == The population of Haryana, according to the 2001 census, is 2,10,83,000, with 1,13,28,000 males and 97,55,000 females.

The term covers written as well as oral communication.  ==Controversy== There is considerable debate over how or whether ''hate speech'' can be defined; whether speech thus labeled ought to be regulated; and if so, how and by whom. Many courts cannot even decide the definition of hate speech. The aforementioned debates center on three critical questions: First, what is the force of speech? Is it the expression of personal thoughts, or is it a form of action that affects and can harm others? Second, is the free expression of ideas which some perceive as hateful necessary for healthy public debate, or is it harmful to public debate? Third, should [[government]]al [[policy|policies]] be founded upon the protection of interests and [[right]]s of individuals, or identifiable groups, such as [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and [[race|racial minorities]]?  ==Legal aspects in the United States and elsewhere==   In the [[United States]], government is broadly forbidden by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] from restricting speech. [[Jurist]]s generally understand this to mean that the government cannot regulate the content of speech, but that it can sanction the harmful effects of speech through laws such as those against [[defamation]] or incitement to [[riot]].  Indeed, the term &quot;hate speech&quot; and its surrounding discussion (whether and to what extent speech should be regulated) is something restricted to American legal discourse.  For example, the [[Grundgesetz|German constitution]] is subtly more restrictive, guaranteeing 'freedom of voicing one's opinion' and elsewhere restricts its misuse against the public peace. The [[German Criminal Code]] specifically forbids inciting hatred against ethnic groups.  Since such laws often apply only to the [[victimization]] of specific individuals, some argue that hate speech must be regulated to protect members of groups. Others argue that hate speech limits the free development of political discourse and ought to be regulated, but by [[volunteer|voluntaristic]] communities and not by the state. Still others claim that it is not possible to legislate a boundary between legitimate controversial speech and hate speech in such a way which is just to those with controversial political or social views.  ==Speech codes== Various instiidgcoa o[el  lu[hmaif  lnd'e &

In those jurisdictions which retain the concept of a [[felony]], the serious crime offence would be a felony; those jurisdictions which have abolished the concept of a felony often substitute instead the concept of an [[indictable offence]], i.e. an offence which requires an indictment. Traditionally an indictment was handed down by a [[grand jury]], but most common law jurisdictions (with the exception of those in the [[United States]]) have abolished grand juries.    == In Australia == In [[Australia]], an indictment is issued by government official (the [[Attorney-General]], the Director of Public Prosecutions, or one of their subordinates). A [[magistrate]] then holds a committal [[hearing (law)|hearing]], which decides whether the [[evidence (law)|evidence]] is serious enough to commit the person to [[trial (law)|trial]].  == In England and Wales == In [[England]] and [[Wales]] (except in [[private prosecution]]s by individuals) an indictment is issued by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS) on behalf of the Crown, i.e. the monarch, presently [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]--who is nominally the [[plaintiff]] in all [[public prosecution]]s under [[English law]]. This is why a public prosecution of a man called Mr. Smith would be referred to as &quot;R v Smith&quot; (short for &quot;Regina versus Smith&quot;, [[Regina]] being Latin for Queen). The head of the CPS is the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]].  == In the United States == In [[United States of America|U.S.]] jurisdictions retaining the grand jury, a charge issued by the prosecutor without presentment of the case to a grand jury (as for [[misdemeanor]] offenses) is usually called an ''information'' or ''accusation'', or sometimes a &quot;complaint&quot;,  to distinguish it from a grand jury indictment. The substance of an indictment or other charging instrument is usually the same, regardless of the jurisdiction: it consists of a short and plain statement of the time, place and manner in which the defendant is alleged to have committed the offense. Each offense is usually set out in a separate count. Some indictments for complex crimes, particularly those involving [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] or numerous counts, can run to hundreds of pages, but many indictments, even for crimes as serious as [[murder]], consist of a single sheet of paper.   Indictable offences are normally tried by [[jury]], unless the accused waives the right to a jury trial. In common law systems, the accused is not normally entitled to a jury trial if the offence charged does not require an indictment; the main exception here is again the U.S., where the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] mandates thtis e if yh pi'f  a r]  t b p]

Generated seq by model:- of partner=== Sexual partners can cover many types, including: * [[Friends with benefits]] * &quot;[[Fuck buddy|Fuck buddies]]&quot; * [[Boyfriend]] or [[girlfriend]] * [[Casual partner]]s * [[Marriage]] or other committed long term relationship * [[Holiday romance]]s * Illicit [[affair]]s * [[Polyamory|Secondary or side relationships]]  Any of these may be explicit, or hidden, deceptive or honest, and may include [[fidelity]] or not.  It is also possible to engage in sexual activity without a partner, or (in some cases) without a knowing partner: * [[Masturbation]] * [[Sexual fantasy|Sexual fantasizing]] * Several [[paraphilia]]s ([[transvestitism]], [[voyeurism]], [[frottage]], and so on)  == Partner selection process ==  A key sexual behavior throughout the entire animal kingdom is the seeking of a sex partner.  Humans are no exception to this rule.  A sexual encounter can be the result of the sending signals indicating readiness for sex, and being receptive to reciprocal signals.  Or, it might be the result of years of planning, through the use of cultural rituals such as courtship and marriage.  Common methods: * Arranged partnership - other adults (often parents) choose partners. In some cultures these are suggestions, in others, they carry the force of commands. * Personal choice - a person chooses for themselves their own partner, according to their own wishes * Status based roles - a high status person in some cultures may choose partners backed by the force of social custom, and low status persoons have little or no choice or expectation of avoiding the same. (For example, some employer-employee liaisons, and [[droit de signeur]]) * Mutual trade - [[prostitution]], or &quot;both gain&quot; type of arrangements.  Additionally, the pool of available and acceptable candidates may be limited, to own town, own religion, similar status, tactically advantageous (eg to cement social bonds or make peace), and so on.  === The search for a partner === ==== Locating and identifying potential partners ==== Before having sex with another person, first it is necessary to find a partner.   Where does one look?  One will never know when or where one will meet someone one is attracted to, so the simple answer to this question is: everywhere!  In the supermarket, in restaurants, at the movies, on the monorail; in short, if you can think it, then it is possible.  Entire industries devoted to enabling sex or sexual communication exist, such as: [[nightclub]]s, [[singles bar]]s, [[Personal advertisement|personal want ads]] (in newspapers and on the web), [[Dating system|dating services]], and [[Prostitution|brothels]], to name just a few.  Many organizations and clubs sponsor events that bring people with similar interests together.  Religious and family connections provide another way for people to meet.  ==== The encounter between potential partners ==== Once a person has located another person with whom they desire to have sex, the first thing to be done is to introduce themselves or position themselves in such a way that he asrrs[l'aielrla vee e [ai[a ac

Generated seq by model:- ncreasingly only found among the poorest people on the smallest farms.  In 1845, for example, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4 to 2 [[hectare]]s (one to five [[acre]]s) in size, while 40% were of 2 to 6 hectares (five to fifteen acres). This included [[marsh|marshland]] and [[bog|bogland]] that could not be used for food production. As a result, holdings were so small that the only crop that could be grown in sufficient quantities, and which provided sufficient nourishment to feed a family, was potatoes. A British Government report carried out shortly before the Famine noted that the scale of the poverty was such that one third of all small holdings in Ireland were presumed to be unable to support their families, after paying their rent, other than through the earnings of seasonal migrant labour in [[England]] and [[Scotland]]. {{fn|1}}  As a result, the Irish landholding system in the 1840s was already in serious trouble. Many of the big estates, as a result of earlier agricultural crises, were heavily mortgaged and in financial difficulty. (10% were eventually bankrupted by the Famine). Below that level were mass tenancies, lacking rent control and security of tenure, many of them through sub-division so small that the tenants were struggling to survive in good years, and almost wholly dependent on potatoes because they alone could be grown in sufficient quantity and nutritional value. Furthermore, efforts of tenants to increase the productivity of their land was actively discouraged by the threat that any increase in land value would lead to a disproportionately high resulting increase in rents, possibly leading to their eviction.  ==Evictions== In a final disastrous twist, local relief was paid for through the [[Poor Law]] Union, which was funded by rates (local taxes) paid by landlords, on the basis of an estate's tenant numbers. This produced the perverse farce of increasing local reliance on the poor law leading landlords to evict impoverished tenants in order to control their rapidly rising rates bills, only to see those evictees, now reliant on the Poor Law Union pushing up rate bills further, leading to more evictions. But if they kept on tenants unable to pay rents, they then might be unable to meet ''their'' rates bill (many estates were already in financial trouble), meaning the Poor Law would not be able to offer local relief, leading to more starvation. {{fn|5}} Only central funding of Poor Law Unions from the exchequer could solve this conundrum, but Russell's government was opposed to this. Some landlords, to avoid ex-tenants relying on the Poor Law, provided passage to other countries, on what became known as [[coffin ship|coffin ships]]. All too many emigrants, already weak, some with [[cholera]], died during the passage to North America.   Ireland experienced a massive number of evictions, due to financial reasons, and infamously to 'clear' their lands to allow cattle grazing, similar to the [[Highland Clearances]], which were happening in [[Scotland]] around the same time.

The name derives from the [[Czech language|Czech]] word ''houfnice'', denoting a [[15th century]]  cannon used by [[Hussite]]s during the [[Hussite Wars]]. Howitzers are distinguished from other types of [[cannon]] artillery by their trajectory in that they tend to fire at high angles and deliver plunging fire. In addition to this the barrel of a howitzer is commonly below 30 calibers (the length of the [[Barrel (firearms)|barrel]] is less than 30 times as long as the diameter of the [[bore]]), whereas other cannon and field guns tend to fire at no more than 45Â° ''and'' have a caliber of 30 or over. Development of the gun-howitzer, a weapon that can fire at both high and low angles was continued after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. With much longer barrels than howitzers, barrel lengths of 39, 45 or longer are now common, they have replaced separate guns and howitzers on the battlefield.  Howitzers are still either towed, or now self-propelled where they mix the maneuverability and to some extent the protection of tanks with their heavy firepower. Small howitzers can be towed by a light vehicle or carried by [[helicopter]]. Most are towed by five-ton or larger trucks. The &quot;pack&quot; howitzer (such as the [[25 Pounder Short Mark 1]]) has existed since before the [[World War I|First World War]]. It can be disassembled into several main components and carried by [[mule]] through very difficult terrain, although the gun size is still a limiting factor and smaller howitzers have generally been abandoned in favor of larger guns with greater capabilities.    Modern self-propelled howitzers such as the [[South Africa]]n [[G6 howitzer|G6]] fire 105 to 155 mm  diameter shells up to about 25-30 km at a maximum rate of about 10 per minute.

Generated seq by model:- ership in Russia was now firmly based and by the middle of the fourteenth century its territory had greatly expanded through purchase, war, and marriage.  ===Ivan III, the Great=== In the 15th century, the grand princes of Muscovy began gathering Russian lands to increase the population and wealth under their rule. The most successful practitioner of this process was [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], the Great ([[1462]]&amp;ndash;[[1505]]), who laid the foundations for a Russian national state. A contemporary of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]]s and other &quot;new monarchs&quot; in Western Europe, Ivan more than doubled his territories by placing most of north Russia under the rule of Moscow, and he proclaimed his absolute sovereignty over all Russian princes and nobles. Refusing further tribute to the Tartars, Ivan initiated a series of attacks that opened the way for the complete defeat of the declining Golden Horde, now divided into several khanates and hordes.  Ivan sought to protect the southern boundaries of his domain against attacks of [[Tatar invasions|hordes]]. Ivan granted manors to nobles, who in turn were obliged to serve in army. The manor system became a basis for an emerging horse army.  During his conflict with Pskov, monk [[Filofei]] composed a letter to Ivan III, with prophecy that the latter's kingdom will be the [[Third Rome]]. Ivan competed with his powerful northwestern rival Lithuania for control over some of the semi-independent former principalities of Kievan Rus' in the upper Dnieper and [[Donets River]] basins. Through the defections of some princes, border skirmishes, and a long, inconclusive war with Lithuania that ended only in [[1503]], Ivan III was able to push westward, and Muscovy tripled in size under his rule.  Internal consolidation accompanied outward expansion of the state. By the 16th century, the rulers of Moscow considered the entire Russian territory their collective property. Various semi-independent princes still claimed specific territories, but Ivan III forced the lesser princes to acknowledge the grand prince of Muscovy and his descendants as unquestioned rulers with control over military, judicial, and foreign affairs. Gradually, the Muscovite ruler emerged as a powerful, autocratic ruler, a tsar.  ===Ivan IV, the Terrible=== [[Image:Kremlinpic4.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|Portrait of Ivan the Terrible.]] Ivan IV was the first Muscovite ruler to use the title of &quot;[[Tsar]].&quot;  The development of the tsar's autocratic powers reached a peak during the reign ([[1547]]&amp;ndash;[[1584]]) of [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]], and he became known as &quot;Ivan the Terrible.&quot;  Ivan strengthened the position of the tsar to an unprecedented degree, as he ruthlessly subordinated the nobles to his will, exiling or executing many on the slightest provocation.  Nevertheless, Ivan was a farsighted statesman who promulgated a new code of laws, reformed the morals of the clergy, and built the great [[St. Basil's Cathedral]] that still stands in Moscow's [[Red Square]].

Generated seq by model:- e of the great altar of Pergamum, now in Berlin. In the [[Argos|Argolid]], near the shrine of the Dioscuri, the 2nd-century CE traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] saw the temple of Hecate opposite the sanctuary of Eilethyia; &quot;The image is a work of [[Scopas]]. This one is of stone, while the bronze images opposite, also of Hekate, were made respectively by [[Polyclitus|Polycleitus]] and his brother Naucydes, son of Mothon. (''Description of Greece'' ii.22.7)  A [[4th century BCE]] marble relief from Crannon in Thessaly was dedicated by a race-horse owner. It shows Hecate, with a hound beside her, placing a wreath on the head of a mare. This statue is in the British Museum, inventory number 816. Her attendant and animal representation is of a bitch, and the most common form of offering was to leave meat at a crossroads. Sometimes dogs themselves were sacrificed to her (a good indication of her non-Hellenic origin, as dogs along with donkeys, very rarely played this role in genuine Greek ritual).  ==Mythology== Despite popular belief, Hecate was not originally a Greek goddess. She is unknown to [[Homer]] and in fact the earliest written references to her are in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]''. The place of origin of her cult is uncertain, but it is thought &lt;ref name=&quot;Burkert&quot;/&gt; that she had popular cult followings in [[Thrace]]. Her most important sanctuary was [[Lagina]], a theocratic city-state in which the goddess was served by [[eunuch]]s &lt;ref name=&quot;Burkert&quot;/&gt;. Lagina, where the famous temple of Hecate drew great festal assemblies every year, lay close to the originally [[Macedon]]ian [[colonies in antiquity|colony]] of [[Stratonikea]]  &lt;ref&gt; Strabo, ''Geography'' xiv.2.25&lt;/ref&gt;. In Thrace she played a role similar to that of lesser-[[Hermes]], namely a governess of [[liminal]] points and the wilderness, bearing little resemblance to the night-walking crone. Additionally, this led to her role of aiding women in childbirth and the raising of young men.  [[Image:HÃ©cate - MallarmÃ©.png|thumb|left|Hecate, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] goddess of the crossroads; drawing by [[Stephane MallarmÃ©]] in ''Les Dieux Antiques, nouvelle mythologie illustrÃ©e'' in [[Paris]], 1880.]]  There was a fane sacred to Hecate as well in the precincts of the [[Temple of Artemis at Ephesus]], where the eunuch priests, ''megabyzi'', officiated &lt;ref&gt; Strabo, ''Geography'', xiv.1.23 &lt;/ref&gt;. Hesiod records that she was among the offspring of [[Gaia]] and [[Uranus]], the Earth and Sky. In ''Theogony'' he ascribed to Hecate such wide-ranging and fundamental powers, that it is hard to resist seeing such a deity as a figuration of the Great Goddess, though as a good Olympian [[Hesiod]] ascribes her powers as the &quot;gift&quot; of [[Zeus]]:  :''&quot;Hecate whom Zeus the son of Cronos honoured above all. He gave her splendid gifts, to have a share of the earth and the unfruitful sea. She received honour also in starry heaven, and is honoured exceedingly by the deathless gods....

It investigates and generalizes the notions of [[Fourier series]] and [[Fourier transform]]s. The basic waves are called &quot;[[harmonic]]s&quot;, hence the name &quot;harmonic analysis.&quot;  In the past two centuries, it has become a vast subject with applications in areas as diverse as [[signal processing]], [[quantum mechanics]], and [[neuroscience]].  The classical Fourier transform on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is still an area of ongoing research, particularly concerning Fourier transformation on more general objects such as [[tempered distribution]]s. For instance, if we impose some requirements on a distribution f, we can attempt to translate these requirements in terms of the Fourier transform of f.  The [[Paley-Wiener theorem]] is an example of this. The Paley-Wiener theorem immediately implies that if f is a nonzero [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] of [[compact support]] (these include functions of compact support), then its Fourier transform is never compactly supported.  This is a very elementary form of an [[uncertainty principle]] in a harmonic analysis setting. See also [[classic harmonic analysis]].  Fourier series can be conveniently studied in the context of [[Hilbert space]]s, which provides a connection between harmonic analysis and [[functional analysis]].  ==Abstract harmonic analysis==  One of the more modern branches of harmonic analysis, having its roots in the mid-twentieth century, is [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] on [[topological group]]s. The core motivating idea are the various [[Fourier transform]]s, which can be generalized to a transform of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s defined on [[local compactness|locally compact groups]].   The theory for [[abelian group|abelian]] locally compact groups is called [[Pontryagin duality]]; it is considered to be in a satisfactory state, as far as explaining the main features of harmonic analysis goes. It is developed in detail on its dedicated page.  Harmonic analysis studies the properties of that duality and Fourier transform; and attempts to extend those features to different settings, for instance to to [ereh  f rihh'oe ii,iaphd.w]

A similar unit of log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; probability, the ''ban'', and its derived unit the [[deciban]] (one tenth of a ban), were introduced by [[Alan Turing]] in [[1940]] as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma]] cyphers.  The ''decibannage'' represented the reduction in (the logarithm of) the total number of possibilities (similar to the change in the Hartley information); and also the [[log-likelihood ratio]] (or change in the [[weight of evidence]]) that could be inferred for one hypothesis over another from a set of observations.  The expected change in the weight of evidence is equivalent to what was later called the Kullback [[Kullback-Leibler divergence#Discrimination Information|discrimination information]].   But underlying this notion was still the idea of equal a-priori probabilities, rather than the information content of events of unequal probability; nor yet any underlying picture of questions regarding the communication of such varied outcomes.  ====Entropy in statistical mechanics====  One area where unequal probabilities were indeed well known was statistical mechanics, where [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] had, in the context of his [[H-theorem]] of [[1872]], first introduced the quantity  : &lt;math&gt;H = - \sum f_i \log f_i &lt;/math&gt;  as a measure of the breadth of the spread of states available to a single particle in a gas of like particles, where ''f'' represented the relative [[frequency distribution]] of each possible state.  Boltzmann argued mathematically that the effect of collisions between the particles would cause the ''H''-function to inevitably increase from any initial configuration until equilibrium was reached; and identified it as an underlying microscopic rationale for the macroscopic [[thermodynamic entropy]] of [[Clausius]].    (The ''H''-theorem of Boltzmann subsequently led to no end of controversy; and can still cause lively debates to the present day, often aggravated by protagonists not realising that they are arguing at cross-purposes.  The theorem relies on a hidden assumption, that useful information is destroyed by the collisions, which can be questioned; also, it relies on a non-equilibrium state being singled out as the initial state (not the final state), which breaks time symmetry; also, strictly it applies only in a statistical sense, namely that an average ''H''-function would be non-decreasing).  Boltzmann's definition was soon reworked by the American mathematical physicist [[J. Willard Gibbs]] into a general formula for the statistical-mechanical entropy, no longer requiring identical and non-interacting particles, but instead based on the probability distribution ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the complete microstate ''i'' of the total system:  : &lt;math&gt;S = -k_B \sum p_i \ln p_i \,&lt;/math&gt;  This (Gibbs) entropy from statistical mechanics can be found to directly correspond to the Clausius's classical thermodynamical definition, as explored fure d dt[tigus]tgt& av'][gg wimt

Generated seq by model:- ury AD]]. The Norse control of the Hebrides was formalized in [[1098]] when [[Edgar of Scotland]] formally signed the islands over to [[Magnus III of Norway]]. The Scottish acceptance of Magnus III as King of the Isles came after the Norwegian king had conquered the Orkney Islands, the Hebrides and the Isle of Man in a swift campaign earlier the same year, directed against the local Norwegian leaders of the various islands. By capturing the islands Magnus III wanted to assume more direct royal control over the islands which had been seized by Viking groups centuries earlier.  The Norwegian control of both the Inner and Outer Hebrides would see almost constant warfare until being ultimately resolved by the partioning of the Western Isles in [[1156]]. The Outer Hebrides would remain under the [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]] while the Inner Hebrides broke out under [[Somerled]], the Norse-Celtic kinsman of both [[Lulach]] and the Manx royal house. Although the Inner Hebrides, from 1156 known as the Kingdom of the Hebrides, still nominally was under the sovereignty of Norway, the leaders were Scottish in language and culture rather than Norse.  After his victory of 1156 Somerled went on to two years later seize control over the Isle of Man itself and become the last King of the Isle of Man and the Isles to rule over all the islands the kingdom had once included. After Somerled's death in [[1164]] the rulers of Mann would no longer be in control of the Inner Hebrides.   In the [[1266]] [[Treaty of Perth]] the Outer Hebrides, along with the Isle of Man, were yielded to the [[Kingdom of Scotland]].  ==See also== *[[Geology of the United Kingdom]] *[[UK topics]] *[[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]] *[[Somerled]] *[[List of Kings of the Isle of Man and the Isles]] *[[List of Kings of the Isle of Man]] *[[Outer Hebrides]] *[[Inner Hebrides]]  ==References== *Ross, David (2005) ''Scotland - History of a Nation''  [[Category:Islands of Scotland]] [[Category:Archipelagoes]]  {{Template:Hebrides}} [[da:Hebriderne]] [[de:Hebriden]] [[et:Hebriidid]] [[eo:Hebridaj Insuloj]] [[fr:HÃ©brides]] [[ko:í¤ë¸ë¦¬ëì¤ ì ë]] [[it:Isole Ebridi]] [[nl:Hebriden]] [[ja:ãããªãã¹è«¸å³¶]] [[no:Hebridene]] [[nn:Hebridane]] [[pl:Hebrydy]] [[pt:HÃ©bridas]] [[fi:Hebridit]] [[sv:Hebriderna]]</text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>Human rights law</title>     <id>14157</id>     <revision>       <id>15911730</id>       <timestamp>2005-05-05T16:39:23Z</timestamp>       <contributor>         <ip>64.241.204.1</ip>       </contributor>       <text xml:space="preserve">'''Human rights law''' is a system of laws, both domestic and international which is intended to promote [[human rights]].

In addition, the silver and small screen composer, [[Danny Elfman]], often uses harpsichord in jazz and classic pieces in his composition, such as the soundtrack for [[Tim Burton]]'s [[Corpse Bride]] which uses both genres.  ===Popular music===  Like almost all instruments of classical music, the harpsichord has been adapted for popular work.  Here are some examples.  *Jimi Hendrix featured a harpsichord in his hit &quot;Burning of the Midnight Lamp&quot; from the Electric Ladyland album.  It is easily heard playing the same main riff as Jimi on the guitar.  *The harpsichord was popular for light jazz music during the 1960s, particularly in Britain. For example, the jazz theme tunes to the ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|Avengers]]'' and ''Danger Man aka Secret Agent TV'' programs from the 1960s both feature harpsichords. [[Lalo Schifrin]] sometimes featured harpsichords in his jazz recordings during the '60s.   *In 1996 [[Tori Amos]] featured the harpsichord on several of her songs of her album &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; - &quot;Caught a Lite Sneeze&quot;, &quot;Blood Roses&quot;, &quot;Professional Widow&quot;, &quot;Talula&quot;, and &quot;In the Springtime of His Voodoo&quot;. She has performed the songs live on [[Saturday Night Live]], playing both a harpsichord and a piano in turn.   *On the [[Abbey Road]] album, [[The Beatles]] used the harpsichord on &quot;[[Because (The Beatles song)|Because]]&quot; (track #8).  *A harpsichord was part of the ensemble for the [[Linda Ronstadt]] song &quot;Long, Long Time.  *A harpsichord is used to provide the accompaniment to singer-songwriter [[Dory Previn]]'s song &quot;Michael Michael&quot;.  *[[The Beach Boys]] used harpsichords on [[Pet Sounds]] and on [[Good Vibrations]] (1966).  *The Japanese psychedelic band [[Ghost (band)|Ghost]] has used the harpsichord.  *[[Warmen]] a melodic metal band uses Harpsichords in many of their songs.  *Queen used a harpsichord on their song &quot;Fairy Feller's Master Stroke&quot; from their album Queen II  *The harpsichord was a key component of the &quot;sound&quot; of recordings created for the popular 1970s TV show and albums of [[The Partridge Family]], featuring [[David Cassidy]].  *The [[Paula Abdul]] Top 10 hit &quot;Blowing Kisses In The Wind&quot; features the harpsichord.  *British group [[The Stranglers]] used the harpsichord to lead their 1982 hit [[Golden Brown]].  *Many Metal bands like Sonata Arctica and Imperanon use their [[keyboard synthesizer]]s to emulate the sounds of harpsichords.  *Joanna Newsom used the harpsichord for the track Peach, Plum, Pear on her Milk-Eyed Mender album.  ==Further reading==  ''Three Centuries of Harpsichord Making'' by Frank Hubbard (1967, Cambridge, MA:  Harvard University Press; ISBN 0674888456) is an authoritative survey of how early harpsichords were built and how the harpsichord evolved over time in different national traditions.  ==External links== {{Commonscat|Harpsichords}} *[http://www.sankey.ws/history.html A brief history of the harcoa m  ]m yot stmme eiatton1f]

Generated seq by model:- K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form [[carbon]] takes in the alloy. 'White' cast irons contain their carbon in the form of [[cementite]], or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation.  In 'grey' cast iron, the carbon exists free as fine flakes of [[graphite]] , and also, renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as 'ductile iron' is specially treated with trace amounts of [[magnesium]] to alter the shape of graphite to sheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material. * [[Carbon steel]] contains between 0.4% and 1.5% [[carbon]], with small amounts of [[manganese]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], and [[silicon]]. * [[Wrought iron]] contains less than 0.2% carbon. It is a tough, malleable product, not as fusible as pig iron. It has a very small amount of carbon, a few tenths of a percent. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised, especially in old samples, by the presence of fine 'stringers' or filaments of [[slag]] entrapped in the metal. * [[Alloy steel]]s contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as [[chromium]], [[vanadium]], [[molybdenum]], [[nickel]], [[tungsten]], etc. They are used for structural purposes, as their alloy content raises their cost and necessitates justification of their use. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost. * [[Iron(III) oxide]]s are used in the production of [[magnetic storage]] in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.  == History == The first signs of use of iron come from the [[Sumerian]]s and the [[Egypt]]ians, where around 4000 BC, a few items, such as the tips of spears, daggers and ornaments, were being fashioned from iron recovered from [[meteorite]]s. Because meteorites fall from the sky some linguists&lt;!--[BenvÃ©niste 1969 cit. dep]--&gt; have conjectured that the English word ''iron'' (OE ''Ä«sern''), which has cognates in many northern and western European languages, derives from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] ''aisar'' which means &quot;the gods&quot;.  By 3500 BC to 2000 BC, increasing numbers of smelted iron objects (distinguishable from meteoric iron by the lack of nickel in the product) appear in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Anatolia]], and [[Egypt]]. However, their use appears to be ceremonial, and iron was ,ethtunepoim'ai htesereeeysd]u

Generated seq by model:- t in its teeth&quot; they actually mean that the horse hardens its lips and mouth against the bit to ignore the rider's commands.  Bits offer varying degrees of control and communication between rider and horse depending upon their design and on the skill of the rider.  It is important that the style of bit is appropriate to the horse's needs and is fitted properly for it to function properly and be as comfortable as possible for the horse.   The types of bits are too numerous to list, but here are some examples:  *[[Curb bit]] *[[Snaffle|Snaffle bit]] *[[Gag bit]] *[[Pelham bit]] *[[Kimberwicke|Kimberwicke bit]]  Bits come in several different mouthpieces and (for snaffles) rings. Some of these include:  Mouthpieces: *Single jointed *Mullen mouth (straight bar) *Dr. Bristol *French mouth *Corkscrew *Single and double twisted wire *Waterford  Rings: *Loose ring *D-ring *Eggbutt *Full-cheek *Baucher *Half-cheek  Bits are designed to work by pressure, not pain. Of course, in the wrong hands even the mildest bit can hurt the horse.  Commands should be given with only the slightest movements of the hands.  Instead of wrenching the horse's head in one direction by force, you should indicate the desired direction by tightening and loosening the grip on the reins.  In fact, the majority of steering, especially in English riding is done with the legs and seat.  The calf of the leg is used to push the body of the horse in a certain direction while the other one is used as a pivot and to provide the correct amount of impulsion required to keep the horse moving. Change of position of the seatbones and hip, and the pressure of the seatbone, are also extremely useful in not only turning, but speeding up and slowing down.  == Harness == [[image:horsecart with watermelons.jpg|250px|thumb|A harness attaches this horse to a horsecart.]] A [[harness]] is a complicated set of devices and straps that attaches a horse to a [[cart]], a [[sledge]] or any other load.  There are as many kinds of harnesses as there are vehicles and loads to attach to a horse.   A horse that is used solely for [[Draft horse|draughting]] will have a ''bridle'', ''[[rein]]s'', ''[[collar (animal)|collar]]'' and ''[[hame]]s'', and ''[[trace (tack)|traces]]''. A horse that is supporting shafts, such as on carts, will also have a saddle to support the shafts and a [[britchen]] to brake the forward motion of the vehicle, especially when stopping or moving downhill. Horses guiding vehicles by means of a pole, such as a [[wagon]], a [[plow]], or a [[dray]], will have at least pole-straps attached to the lower part of their collar.  ==Martingales and breastplates== :{{seealso|Martingale (tack)}} A '''[[Martingale (tack)|martingale]]''' is a strap that (1) keeps the horse from raising its head above a point of control or (2) keeps the horse from tossing its head and smacking its rider in the face.  Martingale types include:  *Running martingale: There are 2 types:  1 has a ''yoke'' around the neck, a part that runs between the front legs and attaches to the girth of a sss&lerw=iim ]ahfb]aeian[ hppa

Generated seq by model:- ident.    The [[Parliament]] was [[bicameral]], with the House of Assembly being directly elected and the Senate consisting of indirectly elected and nominated members, including tribal chiefs. Under the Constitution, there were two separate voters rolls, one for the black African majority, who had 80 % of the seats in [[Parliament]] and the other for whites and other ethnic minorities, such as [[Coloured]]s (people of mixed race) and Asians, who held 20 %.  This gave whites disproportionate representation, and in 1986 the Constitution was amended to scrap this system, replacing the white seats in with seats filled by nominated members. Many white MPs joined [[ZANU]], which then reappointed them. In 1990, the Senate was abolished, and the House of Assembly's membership was increased to include members nominated by the President.  ==After independence==  Following independence, there was increasingly bitter rivalry between ZAPU and ZANU, with guerrilla activity starting again, in Matabeleland (south-western Zimbabwe). Nkomo (ZAPU) left for exile in Britain, and did not return until Mugabe guaranteed his safety. On [[February 17]], [[1982]] Nkomo, accused of plotting a coup, was dismissed. Armed resistance in his stronghold of [[Matabeleland]], in the west, was met with bloody government repression. At least 20,000 died in the ensuing massacres, known in Zimbabwe as the [[Gukurahundi]].  A peace accord was negotiated and on [[December 30]], [[1987]] Mugabe became head of state after reforming the constitution to usher in a presidential regime. On [[December 19]], [[1989]] ZAPU merged with ZANU  under the name ZANU-Patriotic Front ([[ZANU-PF]]).  Although most whites had left Zimbabwe after independence, mainly for neighbouring [[South Africa]], those who remained continued to wield disproportionate control of some sectors of the economy, especially agriculture. In the late-1990s whites accounted for less than 1% of the population but owned 70% of [[arable land]].  On [[December 9]], [[1997]] a national strike paralyzed the country. Mugabe was panicked by demonstrations by Zanla ex-combatants (war veterans), who had been the heart of the liberation struggle 20 years earlier. He agreed to pay them large gratuities and pensions, which proved to be a wholly unproductive and unbudgeted financial commitment.   Mugabe also raised the issue of land ownership by white farmers.  In a populist move, he began land redistribution, which brought the government into headlong conflict with the International Monetary Fund.  Amid a severe drought in the region, the police and military were instructed not to stop the invasion of white-owned farms by the war veterans and youth militia.  In February 2000, Mugabe tried to change the constitution by holding a constitutional referendum, in a move that would have allowed the president to serve two more terms (another 10 years) and the power to dissolve Parliament. The defeat of the referendum weakened the ruling party.  Mugabe won a parliamentary majority for ZANU-PF.  He was also able to appo 'wc eh   .rts d c ltp nwgg1wg

Generated seq by model:-  appreciate my interpreter translating my German!&quot; This statement was followed by laughter and applause. He also used the phrase to end his speech.  The origins of the legend are obscure, but it was perpetuated in [[1988]] when [[William J. Miller]] erroneously wrote in an [[April 30]]th ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article:  &lt;blockquote&gt;''What they did not know, but could easily have found out, was that such citizens never refer to themselves as &quot;Berliners.&quot; They reserve that term for a favorite confection often munched at breakfast. So, while they understood and appreciated the sentiments behind the President's impassioned declaration, the residents tittered among themselves when he exclaimed, literally, &quot;I am a jelly-filled doughnut.&quot;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Although it has no basis in fact, the legend has since been repeated by other reputable media outlets, such as the [[BBC]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/3167810.stm] and [[The Guardian]] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/story/0,16391,1566039,00.html], and in several books about Germany written by English-speaking authors.  Furthermore, the speech had been reviewed by journalist [[Robert Lochner]], who was educated in Germany, and had been practiced several times in front of numerous Germans, including Berlin Mayor [[Willy Brandt]]. The many video and audio recordings of the event show only enthusiastic applause following the statement.  Kennedy did, however, pronounce the sentence with a strong [[Boston accent]], reading from his note &quot;ish bin ein Bear''lee''ner,&quot; which he had written out phonetically.  == The phrase and the legend in fiction and popular culture== The British music group [[Pop Will Eat Itself]] varied the phrase to &quot;Ich bin ein AuslÃ¤nder&quot; (&quot;I am a foreigner&quot;) as the title and chorus of a [[1994]] song expressing solidarity with immigrants and condemning anti-immigrant hate speech as inevitably stoking violence, insisting that &quot;freedom of  expression doesn't make it all right.&quot;  In the [[X-Files]] episode &quot;Schizogeny&quot; Mulder erroneously tells a teen with the poster &quot;Ich bin ein AuslÃ¤nder&quot; that when Kennedy made the statement &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; he was was saying &quot;I am a cocktail sausage&quot; leading to the response &quot;Who's Kennedy?&quot;.  The phrase is also alluded to in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' entitled &quot;Little Girl in the Big Ten.&quot;  [[Lisa Simpson]] is reluctant to enroll in a [[gymnastics]] school in order to help her pass her [[physical education]] class at Springfield Elementary.  However, after having been inspired by a vision of President Kennedy while knocked unconscious, she awakes to claim &quot;Ich bin ein Gymnast!&quot;. [[Homer Simpson]] then remarks that she must have dreamed about [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] again. Also, in another episode of the series, [[Abraham Simpson]] has a flashback in which he hears John F.

In 2001, a reconstituted Hero Games was formed under the leadership of [[Steve Long (Hero Games) | Steve Long]], who had written several books for the earlier version of the system. It regained the rights to the Hero System and to the Champions trademark.  In [[2001]], the Fifth Edition of the Hero System Rulebook was released that had been heavily revised by Long. A large black hardcover, it was critically well-received and attained a degree of commercial success. A revised version was issued in [[2004]]. Also in 2004, a condensed version of the rulebook called [[HERO System Sidekick]] was released with a cover price of under $10.  == Trivia == * When preparations were made for the release of the Fifth Edition rulebook, Steve Long was asked what fans should use as a shorthand for the new release. He was quoted as saying &quot;I don't care if you call it ''Fred'', as long as you buy it.&quot; The name stuck, and the Fifth Edition is frequently referred to in fandom as FREd, which is claimed to stand for &quot;Fifth Rules Edition&quot;. The revised rulebook is often referred to as &quot;Fiver&quot;, a reference to &quot;Fifth Edition&lt; revised&quot; and to the character in the [[Richard Adams (author)|Richard Adams]] novel ''[[Watership Down]]''.  * Although no mathematics operation more complex than division is required to make a HERO System character, the complexity of some contructions has led to a demand for [[software]] to automate the bookkeeping involved. A DOS program called [[Heromaker]] was distributed with some versions of [[Champions]], and a program called [[Hero Designer]] for multiple OS platforms supports the Fifth Edition. The latter is supported by numerous character packs and other extensions linked to Hero Games book releases.  * The massive bulk of the Hero System Rulebook Revised led to much speculation that the volume might actually be ''bulletproof''. The Hero Games website includes a video in which damaged copies of the book are shot with several different firearms, and some of the bullets actually do not penetrate the entire book.  ==See also== *  * [[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]] * [[Fantasy Hero]] * [[Justice, Inc.

Generated seq by model:-  These items were made of wrought iron, created by the same processes used in the Middle East and Europe, and were thought to be imported by non-Chinese people.  In the later years of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (ca 550 BC), a new iron manufacturing capability began because of a highly developed [[kiln]] technology. Producing [[blast furnace|blast furnaces]] capable of temperatures exceeding 1300 K, the Chinese developed the manufacture of [[cast iron|cast]], or [[pig iron]].  Iron was used in India as early as 250 BCE. The famous iron pillar in the [[Qutb complex]] in [[Delhi]] is made of very pure iron (98%) and has not rusted or eroded till this day.   [[Image:Maramec Iron Works furnace a.jpg|thumb|right|250px|This blast furnace in eastern [[Missouri]] consumed up to 11,000 tons of ore and 16,000 [[Wood fuel#Firewood|cords]] of wood annually from 1827 to 1891.]] If iron ores are heated with carbon to 1420&amp;ndash;1470 K, a molten liquid is formed, an [[alloy]] of about 96.5% iron and 3.5% carbon. This product is strong, can be cast into intricate shapes, but is too brittle to be worked, unless the product is ''decarburized'' to remove most of the carbon. The vast majority of Chinese iron manufacture, from the Zhou dynasty onward, was of cast iron. Iron, however, remained a pedestrian product, used by farmers for hundreds of years, and did not really affect the nobility of China until the [[Qin dynasty]] (ca 221 BC).  Cast iron development lagged in Europe, as the smelters could only achieve temperatures of about 1000 K. Through a good portion of the Middle Ages, in Western Europe, iron was still being made by the working of sponge iron into wrought iron. Some of the earliest casting of iron in Europe occurred in [[Sweden]], in two sites, Lapphyttan and Vinarhyttan, between 1150 and 1350 AD. There are suggestions by scholars that the practice may have followed the [[Mongol]]s across [[Russia]] to these sites, but there is no clear proof of this hypothesis. In any event, by the late fourteenth century, a market for cast iron goods began to form, as a demand developed for cast iron cannonballs.  Early iron [[smelting]] (as the process is called) used [[charcoal]] as both the heat source and the reducing agent.  In [[18th century]] England, wood supplies ran down and [[coke (fuel)|coke]], a fossil fuel, was used as an alternative.  This innovation by [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]] supplied the energy for the [[Industrial Revolution]].  == Occurrence == [[Image:IronInRocksMakeRiverRed.jpg|thumb|right|The red appearance of this water is due to iron in the rocks.]] Iron is one of the most common elements on Earth, making up about 5% of the Earth's crust.  Most of this iron is found in various [[iron oxide]]s, such as the minerals [[hematite]], [[magnetite]], and [[taconite]].  The [[earth's core]] is believed to consist largely of a metallic iron-[[nickel]] alloy.  About 5% of the [[meteorite]]s similarly consist of iron-nickel alloy.  Although rare, these are the major form of natural metallic iron on the earth's surface. in  tyh.ae dr][d.[nnneido[ wa

Generated seq by model:- Simon is particularly interested in how these factors directly and indirectly influence the making of decisions.  Weaving in and out of the practical functioning of all of these organizational factors are two universal elements of human social behavior that Simon addresses in Chapter VIIâThe Role of Authority&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and in Chapter XâLoyalities, and Organizational Identification.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;   Authority is a well studied, primary mark of organizational behavior, and is straightforwardly defined in the organizational context as the ability and right of an individual of higher rank to determine the decision of an individual of lower rank. The actions, attitudes, and relationships of the dominant and subordinate individuals constitute components of role behavior that can vary widely in form,style,and content,but do not vary in the expectation of obedience by the one of superior status, and willingness to obey from the suborninate. Authority is highly influential on the formal structure of the organization, including patterns of communication, sanctions,and rewards as well as on establishing the goals, objectives , and values of the organization.   Decisions can be complex admixtures of facts and values. Information about facts, especially empirically proven facts,or facts derived from specialized experience are more easily transmitted in the exercise of authority than are the expressions of values.Simon is primarily interested in seeking identification of the individual employee with the organizational goals and values. Following Lasswell&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; he states that âa person identifies himself with a group when, in making a decision, he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified groupâ&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. A person may identify himself, or herself with any number of social, geographic, economic, racial, religious, familial, educational, gender, political, and sports groups. Indeed, the number and variety are unlimited, and ubiquitous. The fundamental problem for organizations is to recognize that personal and group identifications can either facilitate or obstruct correct decision making for the organization. A specific organization has to deliberately determine and specify in appropriate detail and clear language its own goals, objectives, means, ends, and values. It is further desired that these important factors be internalized in the psychology of the individual participants.   Chester Bernard is cited as responsible for pointing out that âthe decisions that an individual makes as a member of an organization are quite distinct from his personal decisionsâ&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. Personal choices may determine whether an individual joins a particular organization, and continue to be made in his or her extraâorganizational private life. But,as a member of an organization, that individual makes decisions not in relationship to personal needs and results, but in an impersonal sense as part of the organizationali ftnp' beese erhs ]sis an[ .y

Generated seq by model:-  Egypt of a &quot;[[pygmy]] race&quot;.  But the first discoverer of the dwarf races of Central Africa was [[Paul du Chaillu]], who found them in the [[Ogowe River|Ogowe]] district of the west coast in 1865, five years before Schweinfurth's first meeting with them; du Chaillu having previously, as the result of journeys in the [[Gabon]] region between 1855 and 1859, made popular in Europe the knowledge of the existence of the [[gorilla]], perhaps the gigantic ape seen by [[Hanno the Navigator|Hanno the Carthaginian]], and whose existence, up to the middle of the 19th century, was thought to be as legendary as that of the Pygmies of [[Aristotle]].  === Partition among European Powers === ''For details, see the main article [[Scramble for Africa]]''  In the last quarter of the 19th century the map of Africa was transformed.  After the discovery of the Congo the story of exploration takes second place; the continent becomes the theatre of European expansion.  Lines of partition, drawn often through trackless wildernesses, marked out the possessions of [[Germany]], France, Britain and other powers.  [[Railroad|Railways]] penetrated the interior, vast areas were opened up to Western occupation, and from Egypt to the Zambezi the continent was startled into new life.   The causes which led to the partition of Africa can be found in the economic and political state of western Europe at the time.  Germany, recently united under Prussian rule as the result of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, was seeking new outlets for her energies&amp;mdash;new markets for her growing industries, and with the markets, [[Colony|colonies]].    Germany was the last country to enter into the race to acquire colonies, and when [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] - the German Chancellor - acted, Africa was the only field left to exploit. [[South America]] was being protected from interference by the [[United States]] based on the [[Monroe Doctrine]], while Britain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain had already split up most of the other regions of the world between themselves.([[colonization]])   Part of the reason Germany began to expand into the colonial sphere at this time, despite Bismarck's lack of enthusiasm for the idea, was a shift in the world view of the Prussian governing elite. Indeed, European elites as a whole began to view the world as a finite place, one in which only the strong would predominate. The influence of [[Social Darwinism|social-darwinism]] was deep, encouraging a view of the world as essentially characterized by [[zero-sum]] relationships.  For different reasons the war of 1870 was also the starting-point for France in the building up of a new colonial empire.  In her endeavour to regain the position lost in that war France had to look beyond Europe.  To the two causes mentioned must be added others.  Britain and Portugal, when they found their interests threatened, bestirred themselves, while Italy also conceived it necessary to become an African power.  Britain awoke to the need for action too late to secure ppua] slb tni,tdurle su    ne/e

Hunter leaned over the bed and said, '''Sandy, if you want to go out there for awhile &amp;mdash; do that, just know that Juan and I really need you''.'  I was back.&quot;  After nineteen years together and seventeen years of marriage, Hunter and Sandy divorced in [[1980]]; the two remained close friends until Hunter's death.  Thompson got his big break in [[1965]] when he was approached by ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'' editor [[Carey McWilliams (journalist)|Carey McWilliams]] with an idea for a story based upon his experience with the notorious [[Hells Angels]] motorcycle gang. Thompson had spent a year living and riding with the Hells Angels, but the relationship broke down when the bikers suspected that Thompson was making money from his writing, and they demanded a share of the profits. The author ended up with a savage beating, or 'stomping' as the Angels referred to it. After the article was published by ''The Nation'' ([[May 17]], [[1965]]), numerous book offers on the subject came his way, and [[Random House]] published the hard cover ''[[Hells Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs]]'' in [[1966]].   In the late 1960s, Thompson received a &quot;doctorate&quot; in Divinity from a mail-order church while living in [[San Francisco]].  He was jocularly referred to as &quot;the Good Doctor&quot; on account.  ==Middle years== Thompson went on to work for [[Rolling Stone magazine|''Rolling Stone'' magazine]] where his next two books, ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' and ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail 1972]]'', were first serialized.  Published in [[1971]], ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream'' is a first-person account by a journalist (Thompson himself, under the pseudonym &quot;Raoul Duke&quot;) on a trip to [[Las Vegas]] with his &quot;300-pound [[Samoa]]n&quot; [[attorney]], &quot;[[Dr. Gonzo]]&quot; (a character inspired by Thompson's friend, [[Chicano]] lawyer [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]]) to cover a [[narcotics]] officers' convention and the &quot;fabulous [[Mint 400]]&quot; [[motorcycle]] race. During the trip, he and his lawyer become sidetracked by a search for the [[American dream]], with the aid of copious amounts of [[alcohol]], [[LSD]], [[Diethyl ether|ether]], [[adrenochrome]], [[mescaline]], [[cocaine]], [[marijuana]] and other drugs. [[Ralph Steadman]], who collaborated with Thompson on several projects, contributed [[expressionism|expressionist]] pen and ink illustrations.   ''Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72'' is a collection of ''Rolling Stone'' articles he wrote while covering the [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|election campaigns]] of President [[Richard M.

Generated seq by model:- their curiosity. Markets such as Australia have taken interest to Hummers with importers converting the latest H3 to right hand drive despite GM not officially selling the brand in Australia.  From 2006, GM will be building/assembling the Hummer H3 at the Port Elizabeth plant in South Africa to make Hummers internationally available. Hummers at the Port Elizabeth plant will be built for local South African consumption and exported to Australia, the United Kingdom and Japan.  ==Evaluation==  The first two Hummer models are large, heavy vehicles with large engines and complex drivelines. The third one, the [[Hummer H3|H3]], is smaller and geared more towards people who want an everyday SUV.  They also feature aggressive styling and advertising, setting them apart from competing models. This has made them a target of criticism, as many people view Hummers as ill-suited for use as a passenger vehicle on public streets. As fuel prices have risen, detractors have also singled out the Hummer as an egregious waster of resourcesâa charge based largely on the Hummer's fuel consumption and size.  Since both the H1 and H2 can weigh over 8,500&amp;nbsp;lb (GVWR), the United States fuel economy regulations do not apply to them.  GM does not disclose their expected fuel economy ratings, and the company is not required to display a [[Monroney sticker]] on the vehicles.  However, expected [[Miles_per_gallon|mpg]] ratings can be derived from their fuel capacity and range ratings.  These metrics show that the [[Diesel]] H1 is expected to reach 16&amp;nbsp;[[Miles_per_gallon|mpg]] (U.S.), while the H2 should get 9.6&amp;nbsp;mpg.  ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine observed 12&amp;nbsp;mpg with their H2 SUV.  These ratings are similar to those of other heavy trucks and SUVs.  ==Models== &lt;!--[[Image:Hummer20Limo206.jpg|thumb|right|Hummer Limo]]--&gt; There are three current and possibly two future models in the Hummer line: * [[Hummer H1]] * [[Hummer H2]] ** Hummer H2 [[Sports Utility Truck|SUT]]  * [[Hummer H3]] ** Hummer H3T * [[Hummer H4]] * Hummer Hx  ==Licensing== General Motors has been very active in licensing the Hummer brand.

Generated seq by model:- so called the [[Minkowski-Bouligand dimension]]).  These notions (topological dimension, Hausdorff dimension, Minkowski-Bouligand dimension) all give the same value for many shapes. They give different values for some highly irregular curves. Those curves were originally called &quot;[[monster curve]]s&quot; because they seemed so bizarre and non-intuitive at the time. But [[BenoÃ®t Mandelbrot]] says that most shapes found in nature are best modeled by such irregular curves.  ==Formal definition==  The Hausdorff dimension gives an accurate way to measure the [[dimension]] of an arbitrary [[metric space]]; this includes complicated [[mathematical set|set]]s such as [[fractal]]s.   Suppose (''X'',''d'') is a metric space.  As mentioned in the introduction, we are interested in counting the number of balls of some radius  necessary to cover a given set.  It is possible to try to do this directly for many sets (leading to so-called box counting dimension), but Hausdorff's insight was to approach the problem indirectly using the theory of [[countably additive measure| measure]] developed earlier in the century by [[Henri Lebesgue]] and [[Constantin Caratheodory]].   In order to deal with the technical details of this approach, Hausdorff defined an entire family of measures on subsets of ''X'', one for each possible dimension ''s'' &amp;isin; &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,&amp;infin;)&lt;/nowiki&gt;. For example, if ''X''= '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, this construction assigns an ''s'' dimensional measure ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; to all subsets  of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; including the unit segment along the ''x''-axis [0,1] &amp;times; {0} &amp;times; {0}, the unit square on the ''x''-''y'' plane [0,1] &amp;times; [0,1] &amp;times; {0} and the unit cube [0,1] &amp;times; [0,1] &amp;times; [0,1].  For ''s'' = 2, one would expect  * &lt;math&gt; H^2([0,1] \times \{0\} \times \{0\}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;  * &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; H^2([0,1] \times [0,1] \times \{0\}) &lt; +\infty &lt;/math&gt;  * &lt;math&gt; H^2([0,1] \times [0,1] \times [0,1]) = +\infty &lt;/math&gt;  The above example suggests that we can define a set ''A'' to have Hausdorff dimension ''s'' if its ''s''-dimensional Hausdorff measure is positive and finite; in fact we have to modify this slightly.  The Hausdorff dimension of ''A'' is the cutoff value ''s'' where below ''s'' the ''s''-dimensional Hausdorff measure is &amp;infin; and above ''s'' it is 0. It is possible for the ''s'' dimensional Hausdorff measure of an ''s'' dimensional set to  be 0 or &amp;infin;. For instance '''R''' has dimension 1 and its 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure is infinite.  To carry this construction of this measure, we use a theory of measure which is appropriate for metric spaces.  Define a family of [[outer measure|metric outer measure]]s on ''X'' using the ''Method'' II construction of outer measures due to Munroe and described in the article [[outer measure]]. Let ''C'' be the class of all subsets of ''X''; for each positive [[real number]] ''s'', let ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&tbahwcd motl n al0 /ipu;sr]eti

Generated seq by model:- and [[comic book]]s published by [[The Walt Disney Company|the Walt Disney Company]]. Identical [[Triplets|triplets]], the three are [[Donald Duck]]'s [[nephew]]s. Huey, Dewey and Louie were created by [[Ted Osborne]] and [[Al Taliaferro]], and first appeared in a [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] on [[October 17]], [[1937]]. Their first animated appearance was in the theatrical short ''Donald's Nephews'', released [[April 15]], [[1938]].    Huey, Dewey and Louie are the sons of Donald's sister; in ''Donald's Nephews'', Donald's sister is named &quot;Dumbella,&quot; but in the comics, her full name is [[Della Thelma Duck]]. In the original theatrical shorts, they were originally sent to visit Donald for only one day; in the comics, the three were sent to stay with Donald on a temporary basis, until their father came back from the [[hospital]] (the boys had wound up sending him there after a [[practical joke]] of putting [[firecracker]]s under his chair). In both the comics and animated shorts, the boys' parents were never heard from or referred to again after these instances, with the boys ending up permanently living with Donald. All four of them live in the fictional city of [[Duckburg]].  The boys are noted for having both identical appearances and personalities in most appearances, with the three sometimes shown as finishing each others' sentences as a running joke. In the theatrical shorts, Huey, Dewey and Louie would often behave in a rambunctious manner, sometimes committing retaliation or revenge on their uncle Donald for something he did to them. In the comics, however, as developed by [[Al Taliaferro]] and [[Carl Barks]], the boys usually are shown in a more well-behaved manner, usually helping their uncle Donald and great-uncle [[Scrooge McDuck]] in the adventure at hand.  Since the production of the [[1987]] [[animated series]] ''[[DuckTales]]'', Huey, Dewey and Louie can usually be told apart by the color of their hats and/or clothing: Huey dresses in [[red]] (although he used to wear [[Orange (color)|orange]]), Dewey in [[blue]], and Louie in [[green]]. Disney's archivist [[Dave Smith]], in &quot;Disney A to Z,&quot; said, &quot;Note that the brightest hue of the three is red (Huey), the color of water, dew, is blue (Dewey), and that leaves Louie, and leaves are green.&quot;  Before ''DuckTales'', the colors were not applied to the individual characters consistently; each character looked the same until colored, and often which colors belonged to which duck were decided by the colorist.  ==Animation== [[Image:ChronoD02.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The boys as they first appeared in the short ''Donald's Nephews''.]] Huey, Dewey and Louie appeared in a large number of theatrical shorts with Donald, starting with ''[[Donald's Nephews]]'', released in [[1938]].

Generated seq by model:- iacritic mark]]s can be combined with IPA letters to transcribe modified [[phonetic]] values or [[secondary articulation]]s. There are also special symbols for [[suprasegmental feature]]s such as [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].  ===Types of transcriptions=== The [[International Phonetic Association]] recommends that a [[phonetics|phonetic]] transcription should be enclosed in [[bracket|square brackets]] &quot;[&amp;nbsp;]&quot;. A transcription that specifically denotes only [[phonology|phonological]] contrasts may be enclosed in [[slash (punctuation)|slash]]es &quot;/&amp;nbsp;/&quot; instead. If one is in doubt, it is best to use brackets, for by setting off a transcription with slashes one makes a theoretical claim that every symbol within is [[phoneme|phonemic]]ally contrastive for the language being transcribed.   Phonetic transcriptions try to objectively capture the actual pronunciation of a word, whereas phonemic transcriptions are model dependent. For example, [[Noam Chomsky]] transcribed the English word ''night'' phonemically as /nixt/. In his model, the phoneme /x/ is often silent, but shows its presence by âlengtheningâ the preceding vowel. The preceding vowel in this case is the phoneme /i/, which is pronounced [aj] when long. So phonemic /nixt/ is equivalent to phonetic [najt], but only if you share Chomsky's belief that historical sounds such as the ''gh'' in ''night'' may remain in a word long after they have ceased to be pronounced.    For phonetic transcriptions, there is flexibility in how closely sounds may be transcribed. A transcription that gives only a basic idea of the sounds of a language in the broadest terms is called a &quot;broad transcription&quot;; in some cases this may be equivalent to a phonemic transcription (only without any theoretical claims). A close transcription, indicating precise details of the sounds, is called a &quot;narrow transcription&quot;. These are not binary choices, but the ends of a continuum, with many possibilities in between. All are enclosed in brackets.   For example, in some dialects the English word ''pretzel'' in a narrow transcription would be {{IPA|[ËpÊ°É¹Ì¥Ê·ÉÊt.sÉ«Ì©]}}, which notes several phonetic features that may not be evident even to a native speaker. An example of a broader transcription is {{IPA|[ËpÊ°É¹Ét.sÉ«Ì©]}}, which only indicates some of the easier to hear features. A yet broader transcription would be {{IPA|[ËpÉ¹Étsl]}}.

Many of us on-line like to believe that we're a [[utopia]]n community of the future, and Alex's experiment proved to us all that technology is no shield against deceit. We lost our [[innocence]], if not our [[faith]].''&quot; (Van Gelder, 1996, p.534)  ===Trolling in the 1990s=== One early reference to &quot;troll&quot; found in the [[Google#Google_Groups|Google Usenet archive]] was by user &quot;Mark Miller&quot;, directed toward the user, &quot;Tad&quot;, on [[February 8]], [[1990]] [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/alt.flame/browse_thread/thread/44c94ccfa7ede2bf/80135728c2dc034b?q=troll&amp;_done=%2Fgroups%3Fhl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26q%3Dtroll%26qt_s%3DSearch+Groups%26as_drrb%3Db%26as_mind%3D8%26as_minm%3D2%26as_miny%3D1990%26as_maxd%3D11%26as_maxm%3D2%26as_maxy%3D1990%26&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+Search&amp;&amp;d#80135728c2dc034b]. However, it is unclear if this instance represents a usage of &quot;troll&quot; as it is known today, or if it was simply a chance choice of [[Epithet#Linguistics|epithet]]: :&quot;''You are so far beyond being able to understand anything anyone here says that this is just converging on uselessness. The really sad part is that you really believe that you're winning. You are a shocking waste of natural resources &amp;mdash; kindly re-integrate yourself into the [[Food chain|food-chain]]. Just go die in your sleep you mindless [[Flatulence|flatulent]] troll.&quot;''  The more likely derivation can be found in the phrase, &quot;trolling for newbies&quot;, popularized in the early [[1990s]] in the Usenet group, ''alt.folklore.urban''. The usage was somewhat different from the current notion of trolling; it was a relatively gentle inside joke by veteran users, presenting questions or topics that had been so overdone, only a new user would respond to them earnestly. Others expanded the term to include the practice of playing a seriously misinformed or deluded user, even in [[newsgroup]]s where one was not a regular; these were often attempts at humor, rather than provocation. In such contexts, the noun, &quot;troll&quot;, usually referred to an act of trolling, rather than to the author.  Some long-time Usenet users continued to insist on these earlier definitions, even after the term was applied more generally to inflammatory actions, previously characterized as &quot;[[flamebait]]&quot;.  == Identity == In serious [[literature]], the practice was first documented by [[Judith Donath]] ([[1999]]), who used several [[Anecdote|anecdotal]] examples from various Usenet newsgroups in her discussion.  Donath's paper outlines the ambiguity of identity in a disembodied &quot;[[virtual community]]&quot; [http://smg.media.mit.edu/people/Judith/Identity/IdentityDeception.html]:  :&quot;''In the physical world there is an inherent unity to the self, for the boit&eiea]oesgh iagbrdeliidrrlin

Generated seq by model:- 7]], a [[kindergarten]] was established as well. (Today, the [[elementary school]] and the [[Hunter College High School|high school]] still exist at a different location, and are now called the Hunter Campus Schools.)  During Thomas Hunter's tenure as president of the school, Hunter became known for its impartiality regarding race, religion, ethnicity, financial or political favoritism; its pursuit of higher education for women; its high entry requirements; and its rigorous academics. The college's student population quickly expanded, and the college subsequently moved uptown, into a new [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] structure on Lexington Avenue between 68th and 69th Streets.  In [[1888]] the school was incorporated as a college under the statutes of New York State, with the power to confer the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] This led to the separation of the school into two &quot;camps&quot;: the &quot;Normals,&quot; who pursued a four-year course of study to become licensed teachers, and the &quot;Academics,&quot; who sought non-teaching professions and the Bachelor of Arts degree. After [[1902]] when the &quot;Normal&quot; course of study was abolished, the &quot;Academic&quot; course became standard across the student body.  In [[1914]] the Normal College became Hunter College in honor of its first president. At the same time, the college was experiencing a period of great expansion as increasing student enrollments necessitated more space. The college reacted by establishing branches in the boroughs of [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens, New York|Queens]], and [[Staten Island]]. By [[1920]], Hunter College had the largest enrollment of women of any municipally financed college in the United States.  The late 1930s saw the construction of Hunter College in the Bronx (later known as the Bronx Campus). During the [[Second World War]], Hunter leased the Bronx Campus buildings to the [[United States Navy]] who used the facilities to train 95,000 women volunteers for military service as [[WAVES]]. When the Navy vacated the campus, the site was briefly occupied by the nascent [[United Nations]], which held its first Security Council sessions at the Bronx Campus in [[1946]], giving the school an international profile.  Hunter became the women's college of the municipal system, and in the [[1950s]], when [[City College of New York|City College]] became [[coeducational]], Hunter started admitting men to its [[Bronx]] campus. In [[1964]], the [[Manhattan]] campus began admitting men also. The Bronx campus subsequently became [[Lehman College]] in 1968.  The &quot;open admissions&quot; policy initiated in [[1970]] by the City University of New York opened the school's doors to historically underrepresented groups. Many African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Puerto Ricans, and students from the developing world made their presence felt at Hunter, and subsequently altered the composition of the school's student body. As a result of the addition of these &quot;new&quot; students, Hunter created programs in Black and Puerto Ricshoaoicauo l saeset. ocnoolsce

Generated seq by model:- loyer. Moreover, the education, government, services and technology sectors have all dramatically developed as heavy industry has declined.  Also belying its unfounded reputation as cultural wasteland, Hamilton has built on its historical and social background. Unusual and interesting attractions include a flying museum ([http://www.warplane.com Canadian Warplane Heritage]), a stately residence of a premier of the Province of Canada ([[Dundurn Castle]]), a functioning [[nuclear reactor]] at [[McMaster University]], a horticultural haven ([[Royal Botanical Gardens, Ontario|Royal Botanical Gardens]]) and the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]].  ==Geography and Climate== Hamilton is located on the western end of the [[Niagara Peninsula]] and [[Lake Ontario]], and as such is sometimes known as ''Head of the Lake'' (not to be confused with [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|''Lakehead'']]). The two major physical features are [[Burlington Bay]] marking the northern limit of the city and the [[Niagara Escarpment]] running through the middle of the city across its entire breadth, bisecting the city into 'upper' to 'lower' parts.  The escarpment is in many places an almost vertical wall of limestone shale with many waterfalls and creeks falling over it; including [[Stoney Creek]], Redhill Creek, Grindstone Creek, Spencer Gorge Waterfall and Chedoke Creek &amp;mdash; flow over the Escarpment and into the Harbour or Lake Ontario. On average the mountain is 4-5km inland from the Lake Ontario shoreline and at its edge affords some spectacular views of the city and harbour. Outside of the city this feature is more commonly known as Hamilton Mountain, or to locals just &quot;the mountain&quot;.   [[Burlington Bay]], part of Lake Ontario, also known as Hamilton Harbour, separates Hamilton from neighbouring [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]]. The harbour is enclosed, except for the ship canal entrance, by the land below the [[Burlington Skyway Bridge]] which are the Hamilton and Burlington beaches respectively.   The climate of Hamilton is humid continental and relatively mild compared with most of Canada, albeit cold enough in winter. The average January temperature is  -3.6C (26.5F) but most days rise just above freezing making for slushly conditions when snow is present. Winter snowfall averages 113cm (44&quot;) with great year-to-year variation. The average July temperature is 22.5C (72.5F) and humidity is usually high during the peak of summer. Temperatures exceeding 34C (93F) occur but not with regularity. It might be noted that the climate of the lower city is in general much more sheltered and milder than on top of &quot;the mountain&quot;, which has a shorter growing season and, in winter, more [[snowsquall]]s.   Summer rains can be heavy but in general severe weather is rare, one notable exception occurred [[November 13]], [[2005]] when a tornado that lifted off a school gymnasium roof injuring two students.

Purcell incorporated Italian and French stylistic elements but devised a peculiarly English style of [[Baroque music]].  ==Biography== Purcell was  born in St Ann's Lane, Old Pye Street, [[Westminster]].  His father, Henry Purcell (pronounced Pursell with the accent on the first syllable, or in [[ipa]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[pur'ËsÉl]&lt;/nowiki&gt;), was a gentleman of the [[Chapel Royal]], and sang at the coronation of King [[Charles II of England]].  Henry the elder had three sons, Edward, Henry, and Daniel. [[Daniel Purcell]] (d. [[1717]]), the youngest of the brothers, was also a prolific composer.  After his father's death in 1664, young Henry Purcell was placed under the guardianship of his uncle, [[Thomas Purcell]] (d. 1682), who showed him great affection and kindness.  Thomas was himself a gentleman of His Majesty's chapel, and arranged for Henry to be admitted as a chorister. Henry studied first under Captain [[Henry Cooke]] (d. 1672), master of the children, and afterwards under [[Pelham Humfrey]] (d. 1674), Cooke's successor.  Purcell is said to have been composing at nine years old; but the earliest work that can be certainly identified as his is an ode for the King's birthday, written in 1670. (The dates for his compositions are often uncertain, despite considerable research). After Humfrey's death, Purcell continued his studies under Dr [[John Blow]]. He attended [[Westminster School]] and in 1676 he was appointed [[organ (music)|organist]], at [[Westminster Abbey]] and in the same year he composed the music to [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[Aureng-Zebe]]'', and [[Thomas Shadwell]]'s ''Epsom Wells'' and ''The Libertine''. These were followed in 1677 by the music to [[Aphra Behn]]'s tragedy, ''[[Abdelazar]],'' and in 1678 by an overture and masque for Shadwell's new version of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Timon of Athens]]''.  The chorus &quot;In these delightful pleasant groves&quot; from ''The Libertine'' is still performed.  In 1679, he wrote some songs for [[John Playford]]'s ''Choice Ayres, Songs and Dialogues'', and also an [[anthem]], the name of which is not known, for the Chapel-Royal. From a letter written by Thomas Purcell, and still extant, we learn that this anthem was composed for the exceptionally fine voice of the Rev. [[John Gostling]], then e ep.ry] [nn io'ieeto dietioo

In May [[2004]], an Indonesian court may have compounded the country's troubles attracting foreign investment when it ruled in favor of a petition by Indonesian chemical company, [[Tri Polyta]], that a bond issue be declared illegal and nullified, freeing that company of its obligation to repay its debts.   ==Economic relations with the United States== U.S. exports to Indonesia in 1999 totaled $2.0 billion, down significantly from $4.5 billion in 1997. The main exports were [[construction]] equipment, machinery, [[aviation]] parts, chemicals, and agricultural products. U.S. imports from Indonesia in 1999 totaled $9.5 billion and consisted primarily of clothing, machinery and transportation equipment, petroleum, natural rubber, and footwear. Economic assistance to Indonesia is coordinated through the [[Consultative Group on Indonesia]] (CGI), formed in 1989. It includes 19 donor countries and 13 international organizations that meet annually to coordinate donor assistance. The 2000 CGI meeting is to be held [[17 October]]-18 in [[Tokyo]].  The [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID) has provided development assistance to Indonesia since 1950. Initial assistance focused on the most urgent needs of the new republic, including food aid, infrastructure rehabilitation, health care, and training. Through the 1970s, a time of great economic growth in Indonesia, USAID played a major role in helping the country achieve self-sufficiency in rice production and in reducing the birth rate.  USAID's current program aims to support Indonesia as it recovers from the financial crisis by providing food aid, employment generating activities, and maintaining critical public health services. USAID is also providing technical advisers to help the Indonesian Government implement economic reforms and fiscal decentralization and is supporting democratization and civil society development activities through non-governmental organizations.  ==See also== * [[Indonesia]] * [[Economy of Asia]] * [[Taxation in Indonesia]]  {{APEC}} {{WTO}}  [[Category:Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries|Indonesia]] [[Category:Economy of Indonesia| ]] [[Category:Economies by country|Indonesia]] [[Category:WTO members|Indonesia]]  [[es:EconomÃ­a de Indonesia]] [[fr:Ãconomie de l'IndonÃ©sie]] [[id:Ekonomi Indonesia]] [[lt:Indonezijos ekonomika]] [[ms:Ekonomi Indonesia]] [[ru:Ð­ÐºÐ¾Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ð¸ÐºÐ° ÐÐ½Ð´Ð¾Ð½ÐµÐ·Ð¸Ð¸]]</text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>Communications in Indonesia</title>     <id>14648</id>     <revision>       <id>26355341</id>       <timestamp>2005-10-24T13:28:05Z</timestamp>       <contributor>         <username>*drew</username>         <id>91902</id>       </contributor>       <minor />       <comment>{{cleanup}} -&gt; {{cleanup-date|October 2005}}</comment>       <text xml:space="preserve">{{cleanup-date|October 2005}} '''[[Telephone]]s - main lines in use:''' 3.291 million (1995)  '''Telephones - mobile cellular:''' 25.0 million (2004)  '''Telephone]toreea[ahuri[i dsttdbyeu  nle

Generated seq by model:- f Theseus. Our concept of &quot;being the same ship&quot; is perhaps just not clear enough to let us rule definitively that ''S2'' is the same as ''S1''; thus, if we find it convenient, we might just arbitrarily say that they are the same ship.  == The ship of Theseus problem: a non-receivable question == The Ship of Theseus problem is a question that is not receivable because of the mismatch between the [[domain]] of the question and the domain of the subject matter it is applied to. Let us review the three main knowledge domains of concern here: * ''A'', the real [[ontology|ontological]] [[universe]] that exists and happens by itself;  * ''B'', our [[reality]] or how we experience the real universe, ''A''; and * ''C'', or our [[scientific analysis]] of our reality, ''B''.  The distinction between ''B'' and ''C'' is demonstrated in the following example: In the evening, one can go out and see at the same moment the sun setting, the moon and a few stars; this is our reality or ''B''. In the scientific domain ''C'', however, the analysis of ''B'' reveals that the stars are millions of years away, the sun is eight minutes away, and the moon is about half a second away. Since one cannot logically consider these subjects to be both &quot;at the same moment&quot; and &quot;away in time&quot;, an exclusive choice has to be made that defines these two separate domains, ''B'' and ''C''. Our reality or domain ''B'' is created by the complex, but consistent transformation of ''A'' by our biological and mental makeup. Therefore, domain ''B'', or our reality, is internally logical. The scientific knowledge, or domain ''C'', is created by the application of a consistent [[methodology]] of analysis of our reality, ''B''. Therefore, the scientific domain is internally logical. Domains ''B'' and ''C'' each have their own internal logic, derived from a consistent approach respecting both [[process]]es and subject matter. Using the questions or processes of one domain on the subject matter of another domain will logically produce puzzles, [[paradox]]es, and inconsistencies. The Ship of Theseus problem is an example of such an inconsistency created by the use of the question of identity proper to the ontology of domain ''A'', applied to the subject matter of domain ''B'', our reality. The question about the identity of the Ship of Theseus is simply not receivable and comes from the poor practice of not respecting the proper correspondence of the question domain to the subject matter domain. The problem of identity is an ontological problem, and should therefore be applied to the (metaphysical) subject matter of domain ''A'', the real universe.  ==Update== * The sentence, &quot;S1 ''now'' has the property that it ''will'' have mast #2 contains in itself the assumption that S1 ''now'', and S1 ''later'', are the very same ship. It is a little like trying to prove [[theorem]] A using theorem A, is it not? * An example, very similar to the &quot;pilot&quot; example, but perhaps more realistic is: It is said that all the particles ([[atom]]stroieeo,ec  eo  aa i]n]n anrys

Generated seq by model:- ndemning the massacre [http://middleeastreference.org.uk/llb020916a.html].  In the late 1970s, Iraq purchased a French nuclear reactor, dubbed [[Osirak]] or [[Tammuz 1]]. Construction began in 1979. In 1980 the reactor site suffered minor damage due to an Iranian air strike, and in 1981, before the reactor could be completed, it was destroyed by the [[Israeli Air Force]] (see [[Operation Opera]]), greatly setting back Iraq's nuclear weapons program.  === Invasion of Kuwait and the [[Persian Gulf War]] === A long-standing territorial dispute led to the invasion of [[Kuwait]] in [[1990]]. Iraq accused Kuwait of violating the Iraqi border to secure oil resources, and demanded that its debt repayments should be waived. Direct negotiations began in July 1990, but they soon failed. SaddÄm Hussein had an emergency meeting with [[April Glaspie]], the United States Ambassador to Iraq, on [[25 July]] 1990, airing his concerns but stating his intention to continue talks. April Glaspie informed SaddÄm that the United States had no interest in Iraq/Kuwait border disputes.  Arab mediators convinced Iraq and Kuwait to negotiate their differences in [[Jiddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]], on [[1 August]] [[1990]], but that session resulted only in charges and counter-charges. A second session was scheduled to take place in [[Baghdad|BaghdÄd]], the Iraqi capital, but Iraq invaded Kuwait the next day. Iraqi troops overran the country shortly after midnight on [[2 August]] 1990. The [[United Nations Security Council]] and the [[Arab League]] immediately condemned the Iraqi invasion. Four days later, the Security Council imposed an economic [[embargo]] on Iraq that prohibited nearly all trade with Iraq.  Iraq responded to the sanctions by annexing Kuwait as the &quot;19th Province&quot; of Iraq on [[8 August]], prompting the exiled Sabah family to call for a stronger international response. Over the ensuing months, the United Nations Security Council passed a series of resolutions condemned the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and implementing total mandatory economic sanctions against Iraq. Other countries subsequently provided support for &quot;[[Operation Desert Shield]]&quot;. In November 1990, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 678, permitting member states to use all necessary means, authorising military action against the Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait, and demanded a complete withdrawal by [[15 January]] [[1991]].  [[Image:Gulf war soldiers.jpg|thumb|left|222px|''A US Army convoy crosses the [[Iraq]]i desert during the [[Persian Gulf War]].'']]  When SaddÄm Husayn failed to comply with this demand, the [[Persian Gulf War]] (Operation &quot;[[Desert Storm]]&quot;) ensued on the 17th of January 1991 (3 a.m. Iraq time), with allied troops of 28 countries, led by the US launching an aerial bombardment on Baghdad. The war, which proved disastrous for Iraq, lasted only six weeks, one hundred and forty thousand tons of munitions had showered down on the country, the equivalent of 7 [[Hiroshima]] bombs.

Generated seq by model:- diate levels,  with a sufficiently thick layer of wooden litter for rodents, available in pet stores. Although alternative materials may work as well, most of these bear additional threats. Cat litter is  dangerous, because gnawing and eating the chunks is deadly. Cedar and pine based litter/bedding contain an aromatic oil (phenols) which will irritate a hamster's respiratory system so avoid those as well. Litter made from recycled paper/pulp works well to absorb odours and is safe for hamsters.  Hamsters are nest builders and a steady supply of fresh strips of tissue or newspaper (with soy-based ink) allows them to build a secure and comfortable spot in a corner of their enclosure or in their hiding house. Hay, from shops or even fresh from the garden, is also a valuable building material for cozy hamster nests, which, as an additional bonus, is also perfectly edible.  A sand bath can provide a hamster with entertainment and helps them groom.  In the desert (their natural habitat), hamsters will roll around in the sand, which cleans their coat and prevents it from getting too oily.  Dwarf hamsters in particularly enjoy this activity.  Be sure to use a dish that will not tip over.  Heavy ceramic and metal dishes are preferred.  You can fill the dish with fine sand. Avoid sand that is powdery or dusty as it will pose a hazard to a hamster's respiratory system as well.  Regular cleaning of a hamster's home is crucial for the hamster's health.  The home must be cleaned at least once a week by replacing the soiled bedding where necessary.  Hamsters are fairly neat in their bathroom habits; if their enclosure is regularly cleaned, they choose one small location in which to urinate and defecate, making the cleaning simple.  Small hamsters may require slightly less-frequent cleaning (perhaps once every two weeks), and may have many (usually hidden) places used as toilets.  Another important component of a hamster's home is a hiding place where the animal can rest during the day. Not all commercially available houses are adequate. The houses should be of sufficient size and be closed on at least two sides. The same building materials are appropriate for these as for the larger cages, although even a small cardboard box will work (and which will have to be regularly replaced).  Some houses add features such as a removable roof that helps to take away collected food (especially perishable items).   Syrian hamsters are solitary animals and have to be kept alone once they are mature (around 4 weeks and above). Dwarf hamsters are more likely to accept another house mate. While sometimes two or more animals can live peacefully within one home, there can be bloody fights, so separate them as soon as they fight. In their natural habitat, there is substantially more empty space so that each hamster can have its own large territory. If more than one hamster is to live in a cage, then the cage must be larger (at least 40cm x 40cm per hamster) and there must be separate hiding houses for each animal.

The governmental system has been described as &quot;presidential with parliamentary characteristics.&quot; Following the [[Indonesian 1998 Revolution]] and the resignation of President [[Suharto]], several political reforms were set in motion.  ==Reform process== A constitutional reform process has been underway since [[1999]], and has already produced several important changes.   Among these are [[term limit]]s of up to two 5-year terms for the [[President]] and [[Vice President]], and measures to institute checks and balances. The highest state institution is the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPR), whose functions included electing the president and vice president (since 2004 the president is elected directly by the people), establishing broad guidelines of state policy, and amending the constitution. The 695-member MPR includes all 550 members of the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) (the House of Representatives) plus 130 &quot;regional representatives&quot; elected by the 26 provincial parliaments and 65 appointed members from societal groups.   The DPR, which is the premier legislative institution, includes 462 members elected through a mixed proportional/district representational system and 38 appointed members of the armed forces (TNI) and police (POLRI). Under existing agreements, TNI/POLRI representation in the DPR will end at the time of the next general election in [[2004]] and will end in the MPR in [[2009]]. Societal group representation in the MPR is expected to be eliminated in 2004 through further constitutional change. Military domination of regional administration is gradually breaking down, with new regulations prohibiting active-duty officers from holding political office.  Having served as rubberstamp bodies in the past, the DPR and MPR have gained considerable power and are increasingly assertive in oversight of the executive branch. Under constitutional changes in [[2004]], the MPR will become a [[bicameral legislature]], with the creation of the Dewan Perwakilan Daerah (DPD) or Senate, in  nod.o hd|nunstnisi] yfasd[w

Generated seq by model:- ]]. Only in South America and Australia did the extinction occur at family-level or higher.  There are two main hypotheses concerning this extinction: *The animals died off because of [[climate change]]: the retreat of the [[ice cap]] *The animals were exterminated by humans: the &quot;prehistoric overkill hypothesis&quot; (Martin, 1967)  The prehistoric overkill hypothesis is not universally applicable, and is imperfectly confirmed. For instance, the timing of sudden megafaunal extinctions of large [[Australia]]n [[marsupial]]s and a giant lizard, events that followed the arrival of human beings in Australia by many thousand years, need examining. Biologists note that comparably scaled extinctions have not occurred in [[Africa]] either, where the fauna evolved with hominids. Post-glacial megafaunal extinctions in Africa have been spaced over a longer interval.  An alternative to the theory of human responsibility is [[Tollmann's hypothetical bolide|Alexander Tollmann's bolide theory]], a more controversial hypothesis that claims that the [[Holocene]] was initiated by an [[extinction event]] caused by [[bolide]] impacts.  ====Major megafaunal extinctions==== =====Europe===== (circa 15,000 years ago) * [[Woolly Mammoth]] * [[Woolly Rhinoceros]] * [[Irish Elk]] * [[Cave Lion]] * [[Cave Bear]] * [[Giant Hyaena]]  =====Mediterranean Islands===== (by 9000 years ago) * a pygmy [[hippopotamus]] (''Phanourios minutus'') of [[Cyprus]] * the Balearic Islands Cave Goat (''[[Myotragus_balearicus|Myotragus balearicus]]'') of [[Majorca]] and [[Minorca]] * [[dwarf elephant]]s: ''Palaeoloxodon cypriotes'' of Cyprus, ''P. falconeri'' of [[Sicily]] and [[Malta]] * Giant [[Swan]] (''Cygnus falconeri'') of Malta * Giant [[Rat]] of Majorca  =====North America===== (circa 12,000-9000 years BP), 35 to 40 species of large mammals (and only about half a dozen small mammals, such as mice and rats) disappeared. Previous North American extinction pulses had occurred at the end of glaciations, but not with such an imbalance between large mammals and small ones. The megafaunal extinctions include twelve genera of edible grazers ('''G'''), and five large, dangerous carnivores ('''C'''). North American extinctions included  &lt;!--please substantuate this general list--&gt; * American [[Horse]]s, five species (Asian horses survived) ('''G''')  * a few species of  Western [[Camel]]s ('''G''') * North American [[llama|llamas]] ('''G''') * Deer, two genera ('''G''') * Pronghorn, two genera (one survived) ('''G''') * Stag-Moose, Shrub-Oxen, Woodland Muskoxen (an Arctic one survived) ('''G''') * Giant Beaver * Shasta [[Ground Sloth]] and other Ground Sloths * [[Arctodus|Short-Faced Bear]]s (larger than the present [[Grizzly Bear]]), ''cf'' [[Cave Bear]] ('''C''') * [[Saber-toothed cat]]s ('''C''') * American Lion (larger than the current African [[Lion]] but probably a fairly recent immigrant through [[Beringia]]) ('''C''') * American Cheetah ('''C''') * [[Dire Wolf]] ('''C''') * [[Mammoth]], several species  * American [[Mastodont]], ''Mammut americanu h  ls swr oi  lswiyisetoel]u

Generated seq by model:- [[Bridle]]s''' and '''[[halter]]s''' are an arrangement of straps around the horse's head used for [[animal communication|communicating]] with the animal. Bridles contain a ''bit'' attached to ''reins'' and are used for riding and driving horses. On the other hand, halters have no bit, are more general-purpose, and most often equipped for leading (particularly [[horse|pack horse]]s) or tethering a horse with a lead rope. A ''hackamore'' is a type of bitless bridle usually used to train young horses, or to go easy on an older horses mouth.  Hackamores or Bosal's are usually seen in western riding.  '''[[Raised bridle]]s''' have a raised noseband and are seen in English riding, as western bridles rarely have nosebands.  '''[[Double bridle]]s''' use two bits in the mouth at once. The two bits allow the rider to have very precise control of the horse; usually only very advanced horses and riders use double bridles. Double bridles are usually seen in the top levels of [[dressage]], as well as for showing purposes.  A '''[[lungeing cavesson]]''' is a special type of halter used for ''[[lungeing]]'' a horse. Lungeing is causing a horse to walk, trot and/or canter in a large circle around the handler. It is used for training and exercise.  == Reins ==  {{main|Reins}} '''[[Reins]]''' consist of leather straps or rope attached to the outer ends of a ''bit'' and extend to the rider's or driver's hands. Reins are the means by which a horse rider or driver [[animal communication|communicates]] directional commands to the horse's head. Pulling on the reins can be used to steer or stop the horse. The sides of a horse's mouth are sensitive, so pulling on the reins pulls the bit, which then pulls the horse's head from side to side, which is how the horse is controlled.  On some types of harnesses there might be supporting rings to carry the reins over the horse's back. When pairs of horses are used in drawing a [[wagon]] or [[coach]] it is usual for the outer side of each pair to be connected to reins and the inside of the bits connected by a short bridging strap or rope. The driver carries &quot;four-in-hand&quot; or &quot;six-in-hand&quot; being the number of reins connecting to the pairs of horses.  A rein may be attached to a ''halter'' to lead or guide the horse in a circle for training purposes or to lead a packhorse.  == Bits ==  A '''bit''' is piece of [[metal]] that is placed in the horse's mouth, although on occasion the bit may be made of other materials. Despite popular opinion, the bit does not rest on the [[teeth]] of the horse. The bit hangs in a space behind the front &quot;cutting&quot; teeth and in front of the back &quot;grinding&quot; teeth.  This space is known as the &quot;bar&quot;.  When a horse is said to &quot;grab the bit in its teeth&quot; they actually mean that the horse hardens its lips and mouth against the bit to ignore the rider's commands.  Bits offer varying degrees of control and communication between rider and horse depending upon their design and on the skill of the rider.  It is important that '[foent     iaiian   on  ]f it

Exploratory trading adventures, [[raid]]s and [[piracy]] had occurred earlier throughout the Baltic â the [[sailor]]s of [[Gotland]] sailed up rivers as far away as [[Novgorod]], for example â but the scale of international [[economic system|economy]] in the Baltic area remained insignificant before the growth of the Hanseatic League. German cities achieved domination of trade in the Baltic with striking speed over the next century, and LÃ¼beck became a central node in all the sea trade that linked the areas around the [[North Sea]] and the Baltic Sea. The 15th century saw the the climax of LÃ¼beck's hegemony. [[Visby]], one of the midwives of the Hanseatic league in 1358, declined to become a member. Visby dominated trade in the Baltic before the Hanseatic league, with its monopolistic ideology, got rid of the [[Gotland]]ic free-trade competition.  ===Foundation=== [[Image:hanseatic league.JPG|right|Hanseatic League]]  LÃ¼beck became a base for northern German [[merchant]]s from Saxony and [[Westphalia]] to spread east and north. Well before the term ''Hanse'' appeared in a document ([[1267]]), merchants in a given city began to form [[guilds]] or Hansa with the intention of trading with towns overseas, especially in the less-developed eastern Baltic area, a source of [[timber]], [[wax]], [[resin]]s, [[fur]]s, even [[rye]] and [[wheat]] brought down on [[barge]]s from the [[hinterland]] to port markets. Visby functioned as the leading centre in the Baltic before the Hanse. For hundred years the Germans sailed under the Gotlandic flag to Novgorod. Sailing east, Visby merchants established a branch at Novgorod. To begin with the Germans used the Gotlandic Gutagard. With the influx of too many merchants the Gotlanders arranged their own trading stations for the Gemanan Petershof further up from the river.   - see a translation of the  [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1229novgorod-germans.html grant] of privileges to merchants in [[1229]]. They  helped establish key towns on the east Baltic coast - Danzig ([[GdaÅsk]]) Reval ([[Tallinn]]), [[Riga]] and Dorpat ([[Tartu]]), all founded (like others on the Baltic coast) under [[LÃ¼beck law]], which provided that they had to appeal in all legal mbeet lra ip]k 'hrbeaet: t ]oe

Generated seq by model:- he same time.   During the 1st century AD trade and exchange with Scandinavia increased and some Roman artifacts from this period have been found. During the first millennium AD, the population groups of Finland exchanged their products (mostly furs) with Scandinavian traders. Influences came from the south and east as well. The society was stratified: the existence of richly furnished burials, usually with weapons, suggest that a chiefly elite existed from the 3rd century AD onwards. However, a centralized society did not evolve in Finland, not even during the Viking Age.   During this time the population in Finland can be discerned into different groups: (proper-)Finns, [[Tavastians]], [[Karelians]] and [[Sami people|Sami]]. Ãland was possibly Swedified during this time, if not before (although many Finnish-related placenames indicate a large Finnish population). These terms are used in linguistic sense, not to suggest that the Iron Age people would have used or understood modern ethnonyms.  ==The Middle Ages== Contact between Sweden and what is now Finland was remarkable even during pre-Christian times &amp;mdash; the [[Varangian|Vikings]] were known to Finns both due to their participation in commerce and plundering. However, there is no evidence of Scandinavian settlement in Finland during the Viking Age, with the exception of the Ãland Islands.  According to the archaeological finds, [[Christianity]] gained a foothold in Finland during the 11th century AD. According to later sources, [[Saint Henry]], possibly an Englishman, arrived in Finland around [[1155]], apparently to organize the church and ecclesiastical taxes. Probably he was backed by the Swedish king. Henry was martyred soon after his arrival, but a significant cult grew around his memory.     According to the very few written documents that have survived, the Church in Finland was in a chaotic state during the later part of the 12th century. In the early 13th century, the missionary bishop Thomas apparently managed to bring some stability and order. At the same time, there were several secular powers who aimed to bring the Finns under their rule. These included the young Swedish kingdom, [[Denmark]], the Republic of [[Novgorod]] in Northwestern [[Russia]] and probably the German crusading orders as well. Finns had their own chiefs, but no central authority. Despite the cultural and linguistic similarity, feelings of common &quot;Finnish identity&quot; must have been very vague, if existing at all. The name &quot;Finland&quot; signified only the southwestern province that has been known as &quot;[[Finland Proper]]&quot; since the 18th century. The concept of a Finnish &quot;country&quot; in the modern sense developed only slowly during the period of the 15th&amp;ndash;18th centuries. This development was chiefly promoted by the unifying effect of the Catholic Church that considered the populated parts of present-day Finland to be one [[episcopal see]] and took it for granted that the Christians of that see would consider themselves as kinsmen.

The term is commonly accepted and employed at all levels of discourse by Hoosiers themselves, and is considered neither derogatory nor informal.  The word ''Indianan'', as either noun or adjective, is rarely used by or about natives of Indiana.  Deriving from common usage, &quot;Hoosiers&quot; is the team name for [[Indiana Hoosiers|Indiana University athletic teams]], and a movie starring [[Gene Hackman]], about an Indiana high school basketball team that was also called ''[[Hoosiers]]''.   ==Origin of the word== According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the [[etymology]] of the word is unknown, but it has been in use since at least [[1826]].  According to [[Bill Bryson]], there are many suggestions for the derivation of the word &quot;Hoosier,&quot; but none is universally accepted.  It first came into general usage in the 1830s. John Finley of Richmond wrote a poem, [http://www.waynet.org/facts/hoosiersnest.htm ''The Hoosier's Nest''], which was used as the &quot;Carrier's Address&quot; of the ''Indianapolis Journal'', [[January 1]], [[1833]]. As it came into common usage, the debates about the term's origin began.  Some common hypotheses are:  ===Frontier slang=== The most common belief is that the term was a greeting. When approaching a man's home in those early frontier days, you shouted from afar, &quot;Hello, the cabin!&quot; to avoid being shot. The inhabitants would then shout back &quot;Who'sh 'ere?&quot; (who's there). As it got slurred together over time, the country folk came to be called Hoosiers.   Additionally, &quot;Hussar&quot; was a term used on the [[Kentucky]] frontier for people who were public nuisances. According to local tradition, hussars were hard drinking carousers. This theory carries the implication that a large share of such folks came from Indiana.  ===Strongmen=== Indiana rivermen were so spectacularly successful in trouncing or &quot;hushing&quot; their adversaries in the brawling that was then common that they became known as &quot;hushers.&quot;  Additionally, the poet [[James Whitcomb Riley]]v elveoruc  cteprec.c'snna[n;]

Generated seq by model:- pp. 4-5.]. However, worldwide use of the term was uncommon until actively promulgated by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] after WIPO's establishment in 1967.  The first codification of intellectual property can be traced to the Jewish laws codified in the [[Talmud]], which declared a prohibition against &quot;Gnevat ha daat&quot;, literally the theft of ideas. The type of ideas subject to theft and further explanation may be found in the [[Shulkhan Arukh]]. Both texts precede the [[Statute of Anne]] by a few hundred years.  With the [[French Revolution]], which followed the [[American Revolution]], there was debate in Europe over the nature of protection for copyright and patents; those who supported unlimited copyrights frequently used the term ''property'' to advance that agenda, while others who supported a more limited system sometimes used the term ''[[intellectual rights]]'' (''droits intellectuels'').  The system currently used by much of the Western world is more in line with the second view, with limited copyrights that eventually expire.  However, the French Civil Code notion of &quot;moral rights&quot; has connotations similar to natural rights that are inconsistent with the U.S. tradition.  The term &quot;intellectual property&quot; does not occur in the United States Copyright Statutes, except in certain footnotes citing the titles of certain Bills.  The term used in the statutes and in the Constitution is &quot;exclusive rights&quot;.  ==Critique==  {{cleanup-date|July 2005}}  ===Overview===  The purposes of laws dealing with exclusive rights over intangible subject matter or the product of intellectual or creative endeavor have varied, but they all share in common the appearance of granting the &quot;owner&quot; of the exclusive rights a monopoly on copying or distribution of a protected form of &quot;property&quot;.  In [[common law]] jurisdictions, this was historically done to grant a boon to a king's favorite in the form of [[letters patent]] (with some positive advantages to the public, since often these grants were prerequisites before a merchant would undertake production). Jurisdictions with written constitutions generally vest the executive government with power to grant such monopolies or otherwise provide for the protection of intangible property. For example, the [[United States Constitution]] accords Congress the power to promote the progress of science and the useful arts by granting exclusive rights to authors and inventors for limited times.  The use of the term &quot;intellectual property&quot; is often predicated on considerations such as the &quot;[[free rider problem]]&quot; or rationalized by problematizing the fact that owners of computers have the ability to produce and distribute perfect copies of digital works.  Proponents of the term tend to address exclusive intellectual property rights policy by valorizing the incentives afforded to authors and inventors in granting them a right to exact a fee from those who wish to manufacture their inventions or publish thedho,tsi hio ae | ]ol  nuairer]

Generated seq by model:- ing Countries]] (OPEC) outside of the [[Middle East]], and is the only OPEC member that is a net oil importer. In early [[As of 2005|2005]], Indonesian crude oil and condensate output was 1.07 million [[barrel (unit)|barrel]]s per day.  This is a substantial decline from the 1990s, due primarily to aging oil fields and a lack of investment in oil production equipment. In 1999, Crude and condensate output averaged 1.5 million [[barrel (unit)|barrel]]s (240,000 m&amp;sup3;) per day, and in the 1998 calendar year the oil and gas sector, including refining, contributed approximately 9% to GDP. This decline in production since the 1990s has been accompanied by a substantial increase in domestic consumption, about 5.4% per year, leading to an expected [[US dollar|US$]]1.2 billion cost for importing oil in 2005.  The state owns all [[petroleum]] and [[mineral]] rights. Foreign firms participate through production-sharing and work contracts. Oil and gas contractors are required to finance all exploration, production, and development costs in their contract areas; they are entitled to recover operating, exploration, and development costs out of the oil and gas produced. According to President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]], the nation is expected to deplete its crude oil reserves in about 2020.  Although minerals production traditionally centered on [[bauxite]], [[silver]], and [[tin]] production, Indonesia is expanding its [[copper]], [[nickel]], [[gold]], and [[coal]] output for export markets. In mid-1993, the Department of Mines and Energy reopened the coal sector to foreign investment, with the result that the leading Indonesian coal producer now is a joint venture between U.K. firms [[BP]] and [[Rio Tinto (company)|Rio Tinto]]. Total coal production reached 74 million metric tons in 1999, including exports of 55 million tons. The Indonesian Government hopes to surpass 100 million metric tons of coal production in 2002. Two US firms operate three copper/gold mines in Indonesia, with a [[Canada|Canadian]] and [[Britain|UK]] firm holding significant other investments in nickel and gold, respectively. In 1998, the value of Indonesian gold production was $1 billion and copper, $843 million. Receipts from gold, copper, and coal comprised 84% of the $3 billion earned in 1998 by the mineral mining sector.  Indonesia's fuel production has declined significantly over the years, owing to aging oil fields and lack of investment in new equipment.  As a result, despite being an exporter of crude oil, Indonesia is now a net importer of oil and had previously subsidized fuel prices to keep prices low, costing US$ 7 billion in 2004 [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/GC10Ae04.html].  The current president has mandated a significant reduction of government subsidy of fuel prices in several stages [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4200100.stm].  In order to alleviate economic hardships, the government has offered one-time subsidies to qualified citizens.

The major schools of thought are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shi'a]], with [[Sufi]]sm considered as a mystical inflection of Islam.  ===Sunni=== The [[Sunni]] are  the largest group in Islam. In [[Arabic]], ''as-Sunnah'' literally means '''principle''' or '''path'''. Sunnis and shi'ites believe that Muhammad was a perfect human being, and that they must imitate the words and acts of Muhammad as accurately as possible. In fact, the Qur'an states that the character of the Prophet Muhammad was a good example to follow. Because of this reason, the [[Hadith]] in which those words and acts are described are the main pillar of Sunni doctrine. It should be also noted that Sunnis do not believe that Muhammad was sinless(See [[Sin]]){{fact}}.   Sunnis recognize four legal traditions ([[madhhab]]s): [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanafi]], and [[Hanbali]]. All four  accept the validity of the others and Muslims choose any one that he/she finds agreeable to his/her ideas. There are also several orthodox theological or philosophical traditions ([[kalam]]).  ===Shi'a=== [[Image:Dome_of_the_rock_distance.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A view of the [[Dome of the Rock]] on the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]], a holy site in Islam]] [[Shi'a]] Muslims, the second-largest branch, differ from the Sunni in rejecting the authority of the first three caliphs. They honor different traditions ([[hadith]]) and have their own legal traditions. Shi'a scholars have a larger authority than Sunni scholars and have greater room for interpretation. The [[Imams]] play a central role in Shi'a doctrine. Shi'a Muslims hold that Muhammad, his daughter Fatima and the twelve descendants of Muhammad, the [[Imams]], were all sinless and pure.  The arabic word Shi'a, litarally translates into the word 'group' or 'sect'. Originally known as Shi'at Ali (the sect of Ali), the group formed shortly after the death of Ali, in [[Iraq]]. Ali ibn Abi Talib was the cousin of prophet [[Muhammad]], and after marriage to Fatima, he also became Muhammad's son-in-law.  The Shi'a consist of one major school of thought known as the [[Ithna 'ashariyah]] or the &quot;[[Twelvers]]&quot;, and a few minor schools of thought, as the &quot;Seveners&quot; or the &quot;Fivers&quot; referring to the number of infallible leaders they recognize after the death of prophet [[Muhammad]]. The term Shi'a, when used without qualification, is usually taken to be synonymous with the Ithna Ashariyya or Twelvers. Most Shi'a live in [[Iran]], [[Iraq]] (the country where Ali passed away), [[Bahrain]], [[Lebanon]], [[India]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Yemen]] and [[Pakistan]]. A minority group (about 4 million) of Shi'a is kfaaverippti  [f  ]noi ieu]iinl

This viral DNA is then integrated into the cellular DNA for replication using cellular machinery. Once the virus enters the cell, two pathways are possible: either the virus becomes [[latent]] and the infected cell continues to function or the virus becomes active, replicates and a large number of virus particles are liberated which can infect other cells.

Generated seq by model:- mbrist Revolt]] (December [[1825]]), the work of a small circle of liberal nobles and army officers who wanted to install Nicholas' brother as a constitutional monarch. But the revolt was easily crushed, leading Nicholas to turn away from the Westernization program begun by Peter the Great and champion the maxim &quot;Autocracy, Orthodoxy, and Respect to the People.&quot; Russian tsars had also to deal with uprisings in their newly acquired territories of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth: the [[November Uprising]] in 1830, the [[January Uprising]] in 1863.  ====Ideological schisms and reaction==== [[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mikhail Bakunin]]]] The harsh retaliation for the revolt made &quot;December Fourteenth&quot; a day long remembered by later revolutionary movements. In order to repress further revolts, schools and universities were placed under constant surveillance and students were provided with official textbooks. Police spies were planted everywhere. Would-be revolutionaries were sent off to Siberia; under Nicholas I hundreds of thousands were sent to labor camps there.  In this setting [[Michael Bakunin]] would emerge as the father of [[anarchism]]. He left Russia in [[1842]] to Western Europe, where he became active in the socialist movement. After participating in [[May Uprising in Dresden]] of [[1849]], he was imprisoned and shipped to Siberia, but eventually escaped and made his way back to Europe. There he practically joined forces with [[Karl Marx]], despite significant ideological and tactical differences.  The question of Russia's direction had been gaining steam ever since Peter the Great's programme of Westernization. Some favored imitating Europe while others renounced the West and called for a return of the traditions of the past. The latter path was championed by  [[Slavophile]]s, who heaped scorn on the &quot;decadent&quot; West. The Slavophiles were opponents of bureaucracy,  preferred the [[collectivism]] of the [[middle ages|mediaeval]] Russian ''[[mir (social)|mir]]'', or village community, to the [[individualism]] of the West. Later, [[Communism]] in Soviet Russia would owe a debt not only to the doctrines of Karl Marx but also the long-established social pattern of the ''mir''.  ====Alexander II and the abolition of serfdom==== Tsar Nicholas died with his philosophy in dispute. One year earlier, Russia had become involved in the [[Crimean War]], a conflict fought primarily in the [[Crimea|Crimean peninsula]]. Since playing a major role in the defeat of Napoleon, Russia had been regarded as militarily invincible, but the reverses it suffered on land and sea in the Crimean War exposed the decay and weakness of Tsar Nicholas' regime.  When [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] came to the throne in [[1855]], desire for reform was widespread. A growing humanitarian movement, which in later years has been likened to that of the [[abolitionism|abolitionists]] in the [[United States]] before the [[American Civil War]], attacked serfdom.

Generated seq by model:- .  Hammurabi expanded the rule of Babylon by first conquering cities towards the south, before his conquest expanded to cover most parts of Mesopotamia. His military conquests came late in his reign, perhaps brought on by the fall of [[Shamshi-Adad]]'s empire. [[Image:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The upper part of the stela of Hammurapis' code of laws]] He is perhaps best known for [[Wiktionary:promulgate|promulgating]] his code of [[law]]s, known as the [[Code of Hammurabi]]. This was written on a [[stela]] and placed in a public place, so that all could see it, even though very few could read. This stela was removed as plunder to the Elamite capital [[Susa]], where it was rediscovered in [[1901]], and it now stands in the [[Louvre]] museum. While the penalties of his laws may seem cruel to modern readers, the fact that he not only put into writing the laws of his kingdom, but attempted to make them a systematic whole, is considered an important step forward in the evolution of [[civilization]]. The &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; idea comes from his laws.  One fairly new theory is that the modern designation of it as a law code is wrong: it is thus seen merely as a monument &quot;presenting Hammurabi as an exemplary king of justice.&quot; While dealing with many areas of life, the entries do not, by far, cover all possible crimes, and the stele may actually contain contradictions.  While the code was applied and studied extensively in later Babylonian law (as seen in the library of [[Ashurbanipal]]), there as of yet have been no contemporary records discovered that record its use as an actual functioning law code during Hammurabi's own time. :{{seealso|Babylonian law}}  Hammurabi also did other things in order to make Babylon a better place, such as helping to improve the [[irrigation]] process.  Following Hammurabi's successors, the Babylonian Empire collapsed due to military pressure from the [[Hittites]], led by their king [[Mursilis I]]. However it was the [[Kassites]], led by their king [[Agumkakrine]], who eventually ruled Babylon.  Although there were many rebellious cities, the Kassites ruled for 400 years, and respected the [[Code of Hammurabi]].  == References == * Van De Mieroop, Marc.

Generated seq by model:- ndependence]], the recently reinstated French government under [[de Gaulle]] suppressed the protests. The [[massacre]]s that followed marked a turning point in Algerian history.  In April 1945 the French had arrested the Algerian nationalist leader [[Messali Hadj]]. On [[May 1st]] the followers of his [[Parti du Peuple AlgÃ©rien]] (PPA) participated in [[demonstration]]s which where violently put down by the police. Several Algerians were killed. But it was on [[May 8th]], when France celebrated [[Germany]]'s [[unconditional surrender]], that more deaths provoked a violent uprising by the Algerian population in and around [[SÃ©tif]]. The army set villages on fire, and between 6,000 and 8,000 people were killed, according to [[Yves BÃ©not]]; other sources, including the present Algerian government, put the death toll as high as 50,000. Many nationalists drew the conclusion that independence could not be won by peaceful means, and so started organizing for violent rebellion.  The [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954â62), brutal and long, was the most recent major turning point in the country's history. Although often fratricidal, it ultimately united Algerians and seared the value of independence and the philosophy of [[anticolonialism]] into the national consciousness. The systematic use of [[torture]] by the French did not secure military victory, and the abusive tactics of the [[French Army]] remains a controversial subject in France to this day.  Between 300,000 and 1 million Algerians are estimated to have died during the war, and an additional 2 or 3 million, out of a total [[Muslim]] population of 9 or 10 million, were made into refugees or forcibly relocated into government-controlled camps. Much of the countryside and [[agriculture]] was devastated, along with the modern [[Economic system|economy]], which had been dominated by urban [[Europe]]an [[settler]]s (the ''[[pied-noir]]s''). These nearly one million people of mostly French descent were forced to flee the country at independence due to the unbridgeable rifts opened by the civil war and threats from units of the victorious FLN; along with them fled Algerians of [[Jew]]ish descent and those Muslim Algerians who had supported a French Algeria (''[[harki]]s''). Post-war infighting, armed chaos and lynch trials of supposed traitors contributed to tens of thousands of deaths after the pullback of French troops, until the new Algerian government, led by [[Ben Bella]], was able to secure control.  === Military rule === In 1965 the military toppled [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] and  [[Houari Boumedienne]] became head of state.  The military has dominated Algerian politics up to today.  ==Chapters of the series== '''Main article: [[Prehistory of Central North Africa]]'''&lt;br&gt; The area which now consists of Algeria was settled by hunting people who left behind vivid cave paintings of a [[savanna]] region (now transformed into desert).

It is taken from the [[Greek language|Greek]] suffix ''-ismos'' that likewise forms abstract nouns from verbal stems. An example is ''baptism'', from Greek ''baptismos'' &quot;immersion&quot;, derived from ''baptizein'', a Greek verb meaning &quot;to immerse&quot;. Its usage was later extended to signify larger organized systems and concepts &amp;mdash;in [[belief]], [[ideology]], [[doctrine]], and [[ritual]] practice.  The first recorded usage of the suffix ''ism'' as a separate word in its own right was in [[1680]]. By the nineteenth century it was being used by [[Thomas Carlyle]] to signify a pre-packaged [[ideology]]. It was later used in this sense by such writers as [[Julian Huxley]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]].

The museum is a combined medieval, ethnological and archaeological museum and has received architectural prizes for its approach to conservation and exhibition.  It also houses a vast photographic archive for the Hedmark region. [[Image:Vikingskipet-Hamar.jpg|right|thumb|260px|The Viking Ship]] Hamar is also known for its indoor [[speed skating]] arena, the ''Olympia Hall'', better known as [[Vikingskipet Olympic Arena|Vikingskipet]] (&quot;The [[Viking]] ship&quot;) for its shape. It was built to host the speed skating competitions of the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] that were held in nearby [[Lillehammer]].  The centre of Hamar is the pedestrian walkway in the middle of town, with the library, cinema and farmer's market on Stortorget (the big square) on the western side, and Ãstre Torg (the eastern square) on the eastern side.  Hamar is an important [[railway]] junction between two different lines to [[Trondheim]]. [[RÃ¸rosbanen]], the old railway line, branches off from the mainline [[Dovrebanen]]. The Norwegian national railway museum (''Norsk Jernbanemuseum'') is also situated in Hamar.  ==External links== {{commons|Hamar}} * [http://hamar.clickwalk.no/indexe.html Hamar Pictorial click-through] * [http://www.hedmarksmuseet.no/ The Hedmark Museum] * [http://www.norsk-jernbanemuseum.no/ The Norwegian national railway museum]  {{Hedmark}} {{25 biggest cities of Norway}}  [[Category:Municipalities of Norway]] [[Category:Cities in Norway]] [[Category:Hedmark]]  {{Link FA|no}}  [[cs:Hamar]] [[da:Hamar]] [[de:Hamar]] [[it:Hamar]] [[nl:Hamar]] [[no:Hamar]] [[nn:Hamar]] [[pl:Hamar]] [[pt:Hamar]] [[ro:Hamar]] [[fi:Hamar]] [[sv:Hamar]]</text>     </revision>   </page>   <page>     <title>Book of Helaman</title>     <id>14472</id>     <revision>       <id>32509260</id>       <timestamp>2005-12-23T18:51:29Z</timestamp>       <contributor>         <username>Kralizec!</username>         <id>182971</id>       </contributor>       <minor />       <comment>changed link from redirect</comment>       <text xml:space="preserve">{{Template:Books of the Book of Mormon}} '''''The Book of Helaman''''' is one of the books that make up the ''[[Book of Mormon]]''.

For example, the volunteers may be made to believe they are drunk, aliens speaking a strange alien language, naked or seeing others naked, 6-year-old children, ballet dancers etc. Such suggestions are designed to be temporary, lasting the duration of the show. Stage hypnosis is a unique performance in that it involves &quot;real&quot; people from the audience responding in a variety of ways, making no two shows the same. There has been debate over the years as to whether some degree of fraud or collusion may be involved in some stage hypnosis acts.  Regarding the phenomenon of stage hypnotism, Jon Connelly, Ph.D., a therapeutic hypnotist, writes:  ''How does the stage hypnotist create the illusion of &quot;taking over&quot; his subject's minds? It appears they are helpless to refuse whatever he directs them to do under his power and control.''  ''How is this accomplished? It begins with the hypnotist asking for volunteers from an audience already entranced enough with the idea of stage hypnosis that they chose to make attending the show their priority. Naturally, they all have expectations about what they will witness.''  ''The audience is made up of three categories of attendees. The first is prepared, and actually hoping to come up on stage to be subjects despite knowing they will be doing silly things in front of everyone else. The second category is comprised of those who want to prove they can't be hypnotized. These folks are likely to volunteer but only to prove the hypnotist wrong. Finally, the third group is simply interested in watching the show.''  ''The first thing the hypnotist does is to ask for volunteers. On the crowded stage, he &quot;tests&quot; their willingness to cooperate by directing them to do something and he observes their reactions. Anyone not cooperating is eliminated. Seeing others dismissed, enhances the willingness of the remaining volunteers to cooperate even more fully.''  ''The task of finding the most cooperative and dramatic volunteers is accomplished as the hypnotist asks those on stage to do even stranger things and eliminates those whose performance isn't up to par. Soon a small number of volunteers remain. These people are willing to dramatically engage in almost anything the hypnotist suggests. The audience has enjoyed the screening process on another level, believing the hypnotist has caused the subjects to become more and more entranced with hypnosis.''  ''The hypnotist tells the small group of remaining subjects to relax even more into the role of &quot;hypnotized person&quot; he created for them. There is little difference between a good hypnotic subject and a good actor. The context and the understanding each has of why they are doing what they are doing, is the main difference. They both voluntarily throw themselves into the role created for them since both are stage performers.''  ''The stage hypnotist is like a casting director for a movie. The casting director selects people who can vividly imagine and act on what is written in the script as if it was retost dhgt ,yrt  o o ii gtooeli

In [[1980]], the Israeli Knesset confirmed Jerusalem's status as the nation's &quot;eternal and indivisible capital&quot;, by passing the ''[[Jerusalem Law|Basic Law: Jerusalem â Capital of Israel]]''.

The international community argues that Israel's capture of the eastern half of Jerusalem from Jordan during the Six Day War was in violation of international law, and that the final issue of the status of Jerusalem will be determined in future Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Therefore, nearly all countries maintain their embassies in [[Tel Aviv]] [http://cia.gov./cia/publications/factbook/geos/is.html].

Protestant sects which seek to reestablish what they see as ancestral Christian principles -- i.e. [[Fundamentalism|Fundamentalists]] -- sometimes refer to Catholicism (or indeed other Protestant groups) as heretical. One aspect of Catholicism many Protestants regard as heresy against original Christianity is the [[Veneration of saints|veneration of the saints]], and in particular the [[cultus]] of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. Another is the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]], the event where the bread and wine at Mass becomes the Body and Blood of Christ.  ===Heresy in Judaism=== [[Orthodox Judaism]] considers views departing from the traditional [[Jewish principles of faith]] to be heretical. [[Haredi Judaism]] holds that all Jews who reject their specific understanding of [[Maimonides]]'s 13 principles of Jewish faith are heretics. Haredi Jews and some [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] Jews consider [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] to be heretical movements, and regard most of [[Conservative Judaism]] as heretical. The liberal wing of Modern Orthodoxy is more tolerant of Conservative Judaism, particularly its right wing, as there is some theological and practical overlap between these groups.  The Greek term Î¬Î¯ÏÎµÏÎ¹Ï originally denoted &quot;division,&quot; &quot;sect,&quot; &quot;religious&quot; or &quot;philosophical party,&quot; and is applied by [[Josephus]] to the three Jewish sects â [[Sadducee]]s, [[Pharisee]]s, and [[Essenes]].  The specific rabbinical term for heresies, or religious divisions due to an unlawful spirit, is &quot;minim&quot; (lit. &quot;kinds {of belief}&quot;;  the singular &quot;min,&quot; for &quot;heretic&quot; or &quot;Gnostic,&quot; is coined idiomatically, like &quot;goy&quot; and &quot;'am ha-aretz&quot;;).   The law &quot;You shall not cut yourselves&quot; () is interpreted by the Rabbis: &quot;You shall not form divisions, but shall form one bond.&quot; (Source: [[Midrash]] Sifre on Deuteronomy 96)  Besides the term &quot;min&quot; for &quot;heretic,&quot; the [[Talmud]] uses the words &quot;Hitsonim&quot; (outsiders), &quot;[[apikoros]],&quot; and &quot;kofer ba-Torah&quot; (R. H. 17a), or &quot;kofer ba-'ikar&quot; (he who denies the fundamentals of faith; Pes. xxiv. 168b); also &quot;poresh mi-darke tsibbur&quot; (he who deviates from the customs of the community; Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 5; R. H. 17a). Of all these it is said that they are consigned to Gehinnom for all eternity (Tosef., Sanh. l.c.; comp. ib. xii. 9, apparently belonging to xiii. 5: &quot;He who casts off the yoke [of the Law], and he who severs the Abrahamic covenant; he who interprets the Torah against the halakic tradition, and he who pronounces in full the Ineffable Nameâall these have no share in the world to come&quot;).t gip.rerh o n eolhseinedyy n

Generated seq by model:-  always has the same properties, but the properties are of the form ''P''-at-''T''.  This gives us a way to save Leibniz's Law from the objection we gave, but at the same time, brings up the issue of whether ''change'' really occurs. After all, we defined &quot;change&quot; as something having one property at one time, and not at some later time. By this solution though, any given object always has all the properties throughout time, and the properties are merely temporally-specific.  Putting this in plain English, ''S1'' ''now'' has the property that it ''will'' have mast #2; and S2 ''now'' has the property that it ''did'' have mast #1.  We can then say that ''S1'' and ''S2'' have all the same ''[[temporal]]ly-[[index]]ed [[properties]]''. According to Leibniz's Law, therefore, they would be the same ship.  One might also say, through the same sorts of [[contortion]]s that ''S1'' and ''S3'' ''might'' have the same temporally-indexed properties. It then follows from Leibniz's Law that ''they instead'' would be the same ship.  Can Leibniz's Law help us decide whether it is ''S2'' or ''S3'' that is the same as the original Theseus?  Perhaps not by itself.  Leibniz's Law says that some ships are the same, just in case, they have all the same properties and relations &amp;mdash; or, rather, the same ''temporally-indexed'' properties and relations.  How then is one to decide that they have all the same temporally-indexed properties and relations?  Leibniz's Law seems to offer little or no help when it comes to that decision.  == Pragmatic solution == One popular solution to the problem of the Ship of Theseus is to say that the meaning of &quot;same&quot; depends on what purpose the word is being used for. If, supposing it turns out that the original Ship of Theseus, ''S1'', was actually stolen property, and the rightful owner demands its return, should the police give him ''S2'' or ''S3''?  Instead of figuring out which ship, if either, is the &quot;same&quot;, and then declaring that it should be returned, the pragmatic solution is to figure out which ship should be returned, and then declare that it is the &quot;same&quot;. The current owner of ''S2'' could argue that the original owner did not pay for any of the labor or materials of ''S2'', but did provide at least the materials for ''S3''.  Thus, the original owner should not be entitled to ''S2'', but rather, some or all of ''S3''.  For the purpose of [[legal entitlement]], therefore, part or all of ''S3'' is the same as ''S1''.  Now, let us say that the purpose is not legal entitlement, but rather, the following situation:  The [[admiral]] of the fleet believes that [[captain]]s and [[crew]]s who have fought alongside each other are more effective than captains and crews who are strangers to each other.  The admiral then declares that captains must serve at least one year on the same ship.  One day, Captain Hercules takes command of the Theseus, and then transfers 18 months later.  During this time, the ship's materials are completely replaced as in the previous exe tcoishi ni]oid  ls enh aee a

The widespread use of iron revolutionised the [[Bantu]] farming communities who adopted it, driving out the stone tool using hunter-gatherer societies they encountered as they expanded to farm wider areas of [[Savanna|savannah]]. The technologically superior Bantu spread across southern Africa and became rich and powerful, producing iron for tools and weapons in large, industrial quantities.  ==The European Iron Age==  Iron working was introduced to [[Europe]] around [[1000 BC]], probably from [[Asia Minor]] and slowly spread westwards over the succeeding 500 years. In the Netherlands, a starting date from about [[800 BC]] is generally accepted. The Romans introduced writing and therefore ended the prehistoric Dutch Iron Age around 50 A.D.  ===Eastern Europe=== The early 1st millennium BC marks the Iron Age in Eastern Europe. In the steppes north of the [[Black Sea]] and [[Azov Sea]] and the [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasus]], the Iron Age begins with the [[Koban culture|Koban]] and the [[Novocerkassk culture|Chernogorovka and Novocerkassk]] cultures from ca. 900 BC. By 800 BC, it was spreading to [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt C]] via the alleged &quot;[[Thraco-Cimmerian]]&quot; migrations. From the Hallstatt culture, the Iron Age spreads west with the [[Celt]]ic expansion from the 6th century BC. In Poland, the Iron Age reaches the late [[Lusatian culture]] in about the 6th century, followed in some areas by the [[Pomerania|Pomeranian]] culture.   The ethnic ascriptions of many Iron age cultures has been bitterly contested, as the roots of [[Germanic peoples|Germanii]] and [[Slavs]] were sought in this area.  ===Central Europe=== In Central Europe, the Iron Age is generally divided in the early Iron Age [[Hallstatt culture]] (HaC and D, [[800 BC|800]]-[[450 BC|450]]) and the late Iron Age [[La TÃ¨ne culture]] (beginning in [[450 BC]]). The Iron age ends with the Roman Conquest.  ===Mediterranean Europe=== In Italy, the Iron Age was probably introduced by the [[Villanovan culture]] but this culture is otherwise considered a Bronze Age culture, while the following [[Etruscan civilization]] is regarded as part of Iron Age proper. The Etruscan Iron Age was then ended with the rise and conquest of the [[Roman Republic]], which conquered the last Etruscan city of [[Velzna]] in [[265 BC]].  ===British Isles=== ''For a fuller discussion see the [[British Iron Age]] article.'' In [[Britain]], the Iron Age lasted from about the [[5th century BC]] until the Roman conquest and until the [[5th century|5th century A.D.]] in non-Romanised parts. Defensive structures dating from this time are often impressive, for example the [[Broch|brochs]] of northern [[Scotland]] and the [[hill fort]]s that dotted the rest of the islands.   ===Northern Scandinavia and Finland=== Scandinavia (including Finland) and Northern [[Balticum]] shows a small-scaled iron producing very early, but a further dating is currently impes itr' ettuiee. nsae et s  ri

Generated seq by model:- ift Valley, which is a small part of the 6,500-kilometer-long (4,040 mi) [[Great Rift Valley|Syrian-East African Rift]]. In Israel the Rift Valley is dominated by the Jordan River, [[Sea of Galilee|Lake Tiberias]] (known also as the Sea of Galilee and to Israelis as Lake Kinneret), and the [[Dead Sea]]. The [[Jordan River|Jordan]], Israel's largest river (322 km / 200 mi), originates in the Dan, Baniyas, and Hasbani rivers near [[Hermon|Mount Hermon]] in the [[Anti-Lebanon|Anti-Lebanon Mountains]] and flows south through the drained [[Hulah Valley|Hula Basin]] into the [[Freshwater|freshwater]] Lake Tiberias. Lake Tiberias is 165 square kilometers (63.7 miÂ²) in size and, depending on the [[season]] and [[rainfall]], is at about 213 meters (700 ft) below sea level. With a water capacity estimated at 3 cubic kilometers (106 billion cubic feet), it serves as the principal reservoir of the [[National Water Carrier]] (also known as the Kinneret-Negev Conduit). The Jordan River continues its course from the southern end of Lake Tiberias (forming the boundary between the [[West Bank]] and Jordan) to its terminus in the highly saline Dead Sea. The Dead Sea is 1,020 square kilometers (393 miÂ²) in size and, at 399 meters (1,309 ft) below sea level, is the lowest point in the world. South of the Dead Sea, the Rift Valley continues in the [[Arabah|Nahal HaArava]] (Wadi al Arabah in Arabic), which has no permanent water flow, for 170 kilometers (106 mi) to the Gulf of Aqaba.  The Negev Desert comprises approximately 12,000 square kilometers (4,600 miÂ²), more than half of Israel's total land area. Geographically it is an extension of the [[Sinai|Sinai Desert]], forming a rough triangle with its base in the north near [[Beersheba]] (aka Beersheva), the Dead Sea, and the southern [[Judean Mountains|Judean Hills]], and it has its apex in the southern tip of the country at [[Eilat]]. Topographically, it parallels the other regions of the country, with lowlands in the west, hills in the central portion, and the Nahal HaArava as its eastern border.  ; Elevation extremes: :* Lowest point: [[Dead Sea]] -408 [[metre|m]] (-1,339 ft) :* Highest point: [[Hermon|Har Hermon]] at 2,248 m (7,375 ft) in the unilaterally annexed [[Golan Heights]] or [[Meron (Israel)|Har Meron]] at 1,208 m (3,963 ft) within the 1967 boundaries.  ===Climate=== Israel has a [[Mediterranean climate]] characterized by long, hot, dry summers and short, cool, rainy winters, as modified locally by altitude and latitude. Summers are very humid along the Mediterranean coast but dry in the [[Negev]]. The climate is determined by Israel's location between the [[Subtropics|subtropical]] aridity characteristic of Egypt and the subtropical humidity of the Levant or eastern Mediterranean. January is the coldest month, with average temperatures ranging from 5 Â°C to 12 Â°C (41 Â°F to 54 Â°F), and August is the hottest month at 18 Â°C to 38 Â°C (64 Â°F to 100 Â°F).

Generated seq by model:- 1960s' counterculture heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a &quot;no-man's land of the spirit&quot; from which he wondered if they would ever return.  (This attitude echoes a famous passage in [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]].'')  His defense of civil applications of [[nuclear power]] even after the [[Three Mile Island]] incident damaged his relations with some of his fellow liberals.  In a letter reprinted in ''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' he states that though he would prefer living in &quot;no danger whatsoever&quot; than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum, on [[Love Canal]] or near &quot;a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]&quot; (see [[Bhopal disaster]]). He issued many appeals for [[population control]] reflecting the perspective articulated by people from [[Thomas Malthus]] through [[Paul R. Ehrlich]].  Asimov considered himself a [[feminism|feminist]] even before [[Women's Liberation]] became a widespread movement; he joked that he wished women to be free &quot;because I hate it when they charge&quot;.  More seriously, he argued that the issue of women's rights was closely connected to that of population control.  Furthermore, he believed that [[homosexuality]] must be considered a &quot;moral right&quot; on population grounds, as must all consenting adult sexual activity which does not lead to reproduction (''Yours, Isaac Asimov'').  In the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in [[New York City|New York]] on the shrinking [[tax]] base caused by [[middle class]] flight to the [[suburb|suburbs]]. His last non-fiction book, ''Our Angry Earth'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the [[natural environment|environment]]al crisis such as [[global warming]] and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].  ==Asimov's writing career== ===Overview=== [[Image:AsimovOnThrone.png|thumb|300px|right|[[Rowena Morrill]] depicts Asimov enthroned with symbols of his life's work]] Asimov's career can be divided into several time periods. His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]''. He began publishing nonfiction in 1952, co-authoring a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''.  Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the [[USSR]] in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly popular science books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he would write only four science fiction novels. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov would publish several sequels and prequels to ni   sys . eaer  ne lop h]srae

It flows in a south easterly direction, draining into [[Bangladesh]]. The [[Yamuna]] and [[Gomti]] rivers also arise in the Western Himalayas and join the Ganga river in the plains. The Brahmaputra, another tributary of the Ganga originates in [[Tibet]] and enters India in the far eastern state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. It then proceeds westwards, unifying with the Ganga in Bangladesh. [[Image:Narmada.jpg|thumb|220px|The [[Narmada River]] in central India.]] The [[Chambal River|Chambal]], another tributary of the Ganga originates from the Vindhya-Satpura watershed. The river flows eastward. Westward flowing rivers from this watershed are the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] (also called Nerbudda) and [[Tapti]] (also spelt Tapi) rivers which drain into the Arabian Sea in Gujarat. The river network that flows from east to west constitutes 10% of the total outflow.  The Western Ghats are the source of all [[Deccan]] rivers. Major rivers in the Deccan include the [[Mahanadi]], [[Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], and [[Kaveri River]] (also spelt Cauvery), all draining into the [[Bay of Bengal]]. These rivers constitute 20% of India's total outflow. &lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;  ==Bodies of water== [[Image:Pangong lake by martinl.jpg|thumb|250px|The Pangong Lake in Ladakh, is a fine example of a mountain lake in the Himalayas.]] Major gulfs include the [[Gulf of Cambay]], [[Gulf of Kutch]] and the [[Gulf of Mannar]]. Straits include the [[Palk Strait]] which separates India from Sri Lanka and the [[Ten Degree Channel]], separating the Andamans from the Nicobar Islands and the Eight Degree Channel separating the Laccadive and Amindivi Islands from Minicoy Island towards the south. Important capes include the [[Cape Comorin]], the southern tip of mainland India, [[Indira Point]], the southernmost location of India, [[Rama's Bridge]] and [[Point Calimere]].  Smaller seas include the [[Laccadive Sea]] and the [[Andaman Sea]]. There are four [[coral reef]]s in India and are located in; the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, [[Gulf of Mannar]], Lakshadweep and [[Gulf of Kutch]]. {{inote|Manorama pg 580|man-580}}  Important lakes include [[Chilka Lake]], the country's largest salt-water lake in Orissa; [[Kolleru Lake]] in Andhra Pradesh; [[Loktak Lake]] in [[Manipur]], [[Dal Lake]] in Kashmir, [[Sambhar Lake]] in Rajasthan, and the [[Sasthamkotta Lake]] in Kerala.  ==Wetlands== India's wetland ecosystem is widely distributed from the cold and arid; from ones in the [[Ladakh]] region in the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to the ones in the wet and humid climate of peninsula India. Most of the wetlands are directly or indirectly linked to India's river networks. The Indian government has identified a total of 22 wetlands for conservation.

'''Inns''' are [[establishment]]s where [[traveller]]s can procure [[food]], [[drink]], and [[lodging]].  Found in [[Europe]], they first sprang up when the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] built their famous system of [[highway]]s two [[millennia]] ago.  Some inns in Europe are [[century|centuries]] old. In addition to providing for the needs of travellers, inns traditionally acted as [[community]] gathering places.  In today's [[automobile]]-ridden [[world]], real inns are fast dying out.  The few that are left function primarily as [[pub]]s. In [[North America]], inns are usually [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]-serving [[restaurant]]s that have never provided lodging or serviced the needs of travellers.  In Europe, it is the provision of accommodation, if anything, that now differentiates inns from [[tavern]]s, [[alehouse]]s and [[pubs]].  These later tended only to supply alcohol (although in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the conditions of their licence sometimes required them to have a nominal supply of food and soft drinks).  Inns tend to be grander and more long-lived establishments.  Famous London examples include [[the George]] and [[the Tabard]].  There is however no formal distinction between an inn and other kinds of establishment, and many pubs will use the name &quot;inn&quot;, either simply because they are long established, or to summon up a particular kind of image.  The original functions of an inn are now usually split among separate establishments, such as [[hotel]]s, [[lodge]]s, [[motel]]s, [[pub]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[tavern]]s.  In North America, the lodging aspect of the word &quot;inn&quot; lives on in hotel [[brand]] names like [[Holiday Inn]], and in some state laws that refer to lodging operators as innkeepers.  The German words for &quot;inn&quot;, &quot;innkeeper&quot;, and &quot;inkeeping&quot; illustrate the historical importance of inns.  An innkeeper is '''Wirt''' (a [[host]]), the inn itself is a '''Wirtshaus''' (a host's house), and innkeeping is '''Wirtschaft'''.  The last word literally means hosting or [[hospitality]], but is also used to mean [[economics|economy]] and [[business]] in general.  In the [[Greek language]], the word for economy (''oikos'' &quot;house&quot; + ''nomos'' &quot;law&quot;) is actually identical to [[housekeeping]].  The [[Inns of Court]] were originally ordinary inns where [[lawyer]]s met to do business, but have become institutions of the legal profession in [[London]].  ==See also==  *[[Public house]f]e loreshm' ch gsuiy isate aa

All three were appointed in April 2005 after elections which saw political differences papered over by ethnic unity (and inter-ethnic divisions).  ==Legislative branch== The Constitution includes a bicameral legislative body: the Parliament of Iraq. The lower house is the '''House of Deputies:'''. which consists of 275 members known as 'Members of Parliament' elected nation wide in the existing National Assembly constituencies. The Speaker will be elected by the House. The upper house is the '''Senate:'''. This would give equal representation to the ethnicities in Iraq. The members would be known as 'senators'. The Senate shall have an equal number of senators from Sunni Senatorial Districts, Kurdish Senatorial Districts and Shia Senatorial Districts. There shall be 50 senators from each division, thus a total of 150 senators. The President of the Senate will be a Vice President in the Presidency Council chosen by the President.  The Senate will produce three sets of nominations for the Presidency Council and the House of Deputies shall vote on which nomination to elect. The House will have supremacy in financial matters in which the Senate cannot defeat a bill passed by the House and may only delay and propose amendments for 30 days. In other matters the Senate has delaying power of 2 years. The Senate alone can confirm treaties and appointments to federal agencies and departments, high ranking military positions and Justices of the Supreme Court.    ==Political parties and elections== {{elect|List of political parties in Iraq|Elections in Iraq}} {{Iraqi legislative election, December 2005}} :''More info: [[Iraqi legislative election, December 2005]]  ==See also== * [[Reconstruction of Iraq]] * [[State terrorism#State-specific examples|Human orae o iehsseryetidhooeedeeno

Generated seq by model:- n, conducted [[nuclear tests]]. Attempts to restart dialogue between the two nations were given a major boost by the February 1999 meeting of both Prime Ministers in [[Lahore]] and their signing of three agreements. These efforts have since been stalled by the intrusion of Pakistani forces into Indian-held territory near [[Kargil]] in [[Kashmir]] in May 1999. A subsequent military coup in Pakistan that overturned the democratically elected [[Nawaz Sharif]] government in October of the same year also proved a setback to relations.   In [[2001]], a summit was called in [[Agra]], India and Pakistan's military dictator, Pervez Musharraf turned up to meet Indian [[Prime Minister]] Atal Behari Vajpayee. The talks broke down when the Pakistani dictator repeatedly dubbed militants in Kashmir 'freedom fighters' at a press conference. The Indians appeared miffed and the talks fell through.  On [[June 20]], [[2004]], with a new government in place in India, both countries agreed to extend a [[nuclear testing]] ban and to set up a [[hotline]] between their foreign secretaries aimed at preventing misunderstandings that might lead to a [[nuclear war]]. [http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/06/20/india.pakistan]  India has granted Pakistan unilateral MFN (most favored nation) trade status under WTO guidelines, but Pakistan is yet to reciprocate. As of early 2005, both countries are committed to a process of dialogue to solve all outstanding issues. [[Baglihar dam issue]] was a new issue raised by Pakistan in 2005.  ===SAARC===   Certain aspects of India's relations within the subcontinent are conducted through the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation ([[SAARC]]). Its members are [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Sri Lanka]]. Established in [[1985]], SAARC encourages cooperation in agriculture, rural development, science and technology, culture, health, population control, narcotics control and anti-terrorism.  SAARC has intentionally stressed these &quot;core issues&quot; and avoided more divisive political issues, although political dialogue is often conducted on the margins of SAARC meetings. In [[1993]], India and its SAARC partners signed an agreement gradually to lower tariffs within the region. Forward movement in SAARC has come to a standstill because of the tension between India and Pakistan, and the SAARC Summit originally scheduled for, but not held in, November 1999 has not been rescheduled.  In November 1988, at the behest of the Maldivian government, Indian paratroopers and naval forces crushed a coup attempt by mercenaries. India's action, viewed by some critics as an indication of Indian ambitions to be a regional hegemon, were regarded by the [[United States]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Nepal]], and [[Bangladesh]] as legitimate assistance to a friendly government, and to be fully in keeping with India's strategic role in South Asia.  ===People's Republic of China=== ''Main article: [[Sino-Indian relations]]''  Despite lingeri  h eaoey l y etl a a   s aooh

Generated seq by model:- nd most of [[Tonga]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Some of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]] are the only [[Atlantic Ocean]] examples.  Another type of volcanic island occurs where an [[oceanic rift]] reaches the surface. There are two examples: [[Iceland]], which is the world's largest volcanic island, and [[Jan Mayen]]&amp;mdash;both are in the Atlantic.  A third type of volcanic island are those formed over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]s. A hot spot is more or less stationary relative to the moving [[tectonic plate]] above it, so a chain of islands results as the plate drifts. Over long periods of time, this type of island is eventually eroded down and &quot;drowned&quot; by [[isostasy|isostatic adjustment]], becoming a [[seamount]]. Plate movement across a hot-spot produces a line of islands oriented in the direction of the plate movement. An example is the [[Hawaiian Islands]], from [[Hawaii]] to [[Kure Atoll|Kure]], which then extends beneath the sea surface in a more northerly direction as the [[Emperor Seamounts]]. Another chain with similar orientation is the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]; its older, northerly trend is the [[Line Islands]]. The southernmost chain is the [[Austral Islands]], with its northerly trending part the atolls in the nation of [[Tuvalu]]. [[Tristan da Cunha]] is an example of a hotspot volcano in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  An [[atoll]] is an island formed from a [[coral reef]] that has grown on an eroded and submerged volcanic island. The reef rises to the surface of the water and forms a new island. Atolls are typically ring-shaped with a central [[lagoon]]. Examples include the [[Maldives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Line Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].  == See also == {{commons|Island}} *[[List of islands]] *[[List of islands by area]] *[[List of islands by population]] *[[Island nation]] *[[Reef]] *[[Desert island]] *[[Tidal island]] *[[List of artificial islands]] *[[List of divided islands]] *[[Skerry]] *[[Ait]] *[[List of fictional islands]]  ==External links== *[http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part8.htm Definition of island] from [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] *[http://islands.unep.ch/isldir.htm Listing of islands] from [[United Nations]] Island Directory.

These autos are the new incarnation of old Fat-fats, which were Harley-Davidson and similar powerful motorcycles modified by removing the rear wheel and bolting a two-wheeled platform with bench seats onto the rear.  ===Two-wheelers=== Two wheelers are the most popular mode of transport in terms of number of vehicles. There are two main types of powered two-wheelers, the [[motor scooter]] and the [[motorcycle]].  The scooter was first built in post-war Italy as a two-wheeler with small wheels (supposedly to utilize war-surplus aircraft tailwheels). It differs from the motorcycle in having the driver seated with his legs together, and is thus favoured by women drivers (as [[sari]], a common Indian dress for women, doesn't permit separation of legs). The Italian Vespa scooter was built in India under licence by Bajaj Auto, and together with the Italian Lambretta scooter dominated the two-wheeler scene. Much later came the hugely successful [[Bajaj Chetak]] scooter, but Bajaj has since lost the market to new entrants like Kinetic Motors. In the past decade, lightweight mini-scooters like the [[TVS, India|TVS]] Scooty and the [[Honda]] Activa have made it much easier for women to travel.  [[Image:DSC00076.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A main road in [[New Delhi]]. In India, driving is on the right side of road.]]  The post-war years saw the predominance of foreign motorcycles, mainly British ones like Norton, BSA, Ariel etc. In the 1960s Indian-made bikes like Royal Enfield Bullet (a 350cc British design), Jawa (a 250cc Czech design) and Rajdoot (a 175cc Polish design) predominated. After the beginning of liberalization Indian versions of popular Japanese bikes such as Suzuki, Honda, Kawasaki and Yamaha hit the roads, leading to motorcycles outstripping scooters in popularity. The overwhelmingly large number of bikes sold have engines 175cc or less.  ===Cars=== The demand for [[car]]s in India is one of the highest in the world. In [[2002]], more than 50,000 new cars were brought in Delhi alone. [[Compact car]]s predominate due to low cost. [[Maruti Udyog|Maruti]], [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]], [[Tata Motors]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] are the most popular brands in the order of their market share. The clunky [[Ambassador]] once had a monopoly but is now an icon of pre-[[Economic history of India|liberalisation]] India, and is still used by politicians. [[Maruti 800]] launched in [[1984]] created the first revolution in the Indian auto sector because of its low pricing. It had the highest market share until 2004, when it was overtaken by other low cost models of Maruti and those of foreign entrants like Hyundai. Over the 20 year period since its introduction about 2.4 milion units of Maruti 800 have been sold.  ===Utility Vehicles=== The first [[utility vehicle]] in India was manufactured by [[Mahindra and Mahindra]]. The vehicle was an instant hit and made Mahindra Corp one of the top companies in India. The [[Indian Army]] and police extensively used Mahindra vehiclecnst.m ed ts cdoa'r    eeepomr

In addition, it has been expanded to the notion of remembering &quot;past lives&quot;, that is, previous [[reincarnation|reincarnations]] of the subject, in such movies as &quot;DEAD AGAIN.&quot;  In real-life cases, recollection of knowledge via hypnosis has been used in many cases, but its effectiveness is disputed. Proponents claim that recovered memories have aided in the solving of many crimes, often corroborating with physical evidence which would have been impossible to obtain otherwise. Skeptics suggest that such successes are a function of simple chance, pointing to cases where its use on victims of rape or attempted murder to help them jog their memory in identifying an accused has caused sentences to be doled out to the wrong person. This is because the hypnotist might make suggestions that are more likely to be remembered as &quot;truth&quot;. Most experts recommend that the practice be used at most like a [[lie detector]], to glean more information, and never as the smoking gun.  The notion of implanting suggestions is probably the most thoroughly explored; ranging from comedies such as ''[[The Naked Gun]]'' trilogy to dramas such as [[The Manchurian Candidate]]. These films usually center around the concept of [[brainwashing]] or [[mind control]]. Several cases have been recorded where the defense argued the accused had committed the murder under hypnosis, though there is little real evidence that such control is possible.    ==See also== * [[Chicken hypnotism]] * [[Highway hypnosis]] * [[Hypnotherapy]] * [[Hypnagogia]] * [[Hypnofetishism]] * [[Hypnosis (novel)]] * [[Lucid dreaming]] * [[Neuro-linguistic programming]] * [[Sedative]] (also known as sedative-hypnotic drug) * [[Post hypnotic suggestion]] * [[Trout tickling]]  ==References== ===Footnotes=== # {{note|APA}}&amp;mdash; Executive Committee of the American Psychological Association Division of Psychological Hypnosis [1993, Fall].

Generated seq by model:- istorians. However, even though by the 1880s Ireland went through an economic boom unprecedented until the [[Celtic Tiger]] era, emigration, often of children who no longer could inherit a share in the land and who as a result chose to go abroad for economic advantage and to avoid poverty, continued. By the [[1911]] census, the island of Ireland's population had fallen to 4.4 million, about the same as the population in [[1800]] and [[2000]] and only a half of its peak population.   The same mould (''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'') was responsible for the 1847-51 and later famines.  When people speak of &quot;the Irish famine&quot;, or &quot;''an Gorta MÃ³r''&quot;, they nearly always mean the one of the [[1840s]], even though a similar Great Famine did in fact hit in the early [[18th century]]. The fact that only four types of potato were brought from [[the Americas]] was a fundamental cause of the famine, as the lack of [[genetic diversity]] made it possible for a single [[fungus]]-relative to have much more devastating consequences than it might otherwise have had.  ==Emigration== As a result of the famine, many Irish families were forced to [[emigrate]] from the country.  By [[1854]], between 1.5 and 2 million Irish left their country.  In the [[United States]], most Irish became city-dwellers.  With little money, many had to settle in the cities that the ships they came on landed in.  By [[1850]], the Irish made up a quarter of the population in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], and [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]. The 1851 census reported that about one third of the inhabitants of [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]], [[Canada]], were Irish. The Famine is often seen as an initiator in the steep depopulation of Ireland in the 19th century, however, it is likely that real population began to fall in 1841 with the Famine accelerating any population changes already occurring. Some may argue the Famine was necessary to restore population equilibrium to Ireland given that population increased by 13-14% in the first three decades of the 19th century (using Thomas Mathus's idea of population expanding geometrically, resources increasing arithmetically) nonetheless there is a tendency among Irish historians to dispute this. Statistics show that between 1831 and 1841 population grew by only 5% so this gives more value to those who argue that population was already falling by 1844.   The mass exodus in the years following the famine must be seen in the context of overpopulation, industrial stagnation, land shortages, declining agricultural employment and inadequate diet. These factors were already combining to choke off population growth by the 1830s. It would be wrong, therefore, to attribute all the population loss during the famine, to the famine.  ==Memorials to the famine== The Great Famine is still remembered in many locations throughout Ireland, especially in those regions which suffered the greatest losses, and also in cities overseas with large populations de trshdo   rrure e htou]s].oae

On [[March 13]], [[1954 in sports|1954]], Braves left fielder [[Bobby Thomson]] broke his ankle sliding into second base during a spring training game.  The next day Aaron made his first spring training start for the Braves in left field and hit a home run.  ===Major leagues=== ====The early years==== [[Image:Hankaaron-young.jpg|frame|left|Hank Aaron team portrait]] On [[April 13]], [[1954 in sports|1954]], Aaron made his major league debut and went 0-for-5 against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]' [[Joe Nuxhall]].  In the same game, Aaron's teammate, [[Eddie Mathews]] hit two home runs, the first two of a record 863 home runs the pair would hit as teammates.  On [[April 15]], [[1954 in sports|1954]] Aaron got his first major league hit, a single off of [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] pitcher [[Vic Raschi]].  Aaron hit his first Major League home run on [[April 23]], [[1954 in sports|1954]] off of Raschi. Over the next 122 games, Aaron batted .280 (he would not hit that low again until [[1966 in sports|1966]]) with 13 homers (he wouldn't go below 20 for the next 20 years) before suffering a broken ankle on [[September 5]].   In the following season, Aaron was moved to [[right field]], where he played for most of his career, winning three Gold Gloves.  [[1955 in sports|1955]] also saw the first of a record-tying 24 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]] for Aaron &amp;ndash; only [[Willie Mays]] and [[Stan Musial]] appeared in as many All-Star Games.  On [[June 24]], [[1955 in sports|1955]], Aaron became the first strike out victim of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]' future Hall of Famer, [[Sandy Koufax]].  Koufax came on in relief for the Dodgers on [[Milwaukee]]'s [[County Stadium]], pitching two shutout innings and fanning two.  Aaron finished the season batting .314 with 27 home runs and 106 RBI.  [[1956 in sports|1956]] saw Aaron hit .328 to win the first of two [[National League|NL]] batting titles.  He is also named [[Sporting News|The Sporting News]]' NL Player of the Year. Two changes were made in [[1957 in sports|1957]] that had a profound effect on Aaron.  First, he went from second in the batting order to fourth, behind [[Eddie Mathews]] instead of in front of him, and, second, he switched from a 36-ounce bat to a 34-ounce model.  Aaron responded by leading the league with 44 home runs, a career-high 132 RBI, batted .322 and won his only NL [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|MVP Award]].  During a game on [[August 15]]th, Aaron belted his 100th major league home run off of the Reds' [[Don Gross]].  On [[September 23]], [[1957 in sports|1957]], Aaron had what he called the best moment of his career.  Aaron drilled a pitch from the [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]]' [[Billy Muffett]] for a two-run homer in the 11th inning of a game.  It clinched the Braves' first pennant in Milwaukee and Aaron was carried off the field by his teammates.

Scripts may indicate [[morpheme]]s (so called [[logogram]]s like ''[[hanja]]''), [[syllable]]s (like ''[[kana]]''), or segments (an [[alphabet]] of consonants and/or vowels, like the one you're reading here). Hangul goes further than this, in indicating individual distinctive [[phonetics|phonetic]] features such as [[place of articulation]] ([[labial consonant|labial]], [[coronal consonant|coronal]], [[velar consonant|velar]], [[glottal consonant|glottal]]) and [[manner of articulation]] ([[plosive]], [[nasal consonant|nasal]], [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]], [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]]) for consonant ''jamo'', and iotation (a preceding ''i-'' sound), [[Vowel harmony|harmonic class]], and [[umlaut]] for vowel ''jamo''.   For instance, the ''jamo'' ã ''t'' is composed of three strokes, each one meaningful: the top stroke indicates it is a plosive, like ã â, ã± ''g'', ã· ''d'', ã ''b'', ã ''j'', which have the same stroke (the last is an [[Affricate consonant|affricate]], a plosive-fricative sequence); the middle stroke indicates that it is aspirated, like ã ''h'', ã ''k'', ã ''p'', ã ''ch'', which also have this stroke; and the curved bottom stroke indicates that it's coronal, like ã´ ''n'', ã· ''d'', ã¹ ''l''. Two consonants, á° and á¢, have dual pronunciations, and may be composed of two elements to represent these ({{IPA|[Å]}}/silent and {{IPA|[m]}}/{{IPA|[w]}}, respectively).  With vowel ''jamo'', what was originally a dot (now a short connected line) indicates that it ''may'' be iotated; this dot is then doubled to indicate actual iotation (''i-''). The position of the dot indicates which harmonic class the vowel belongs to ([[yin and yang|&quot;light&quot;]] or [[yin and yang|&quot;dark&quot;]]). In the modern ''jamo'', an additional vertical stroke indicates [[umlaut]], deriving ã {{IPA|[Îµ]}}, ã {{IPA|[e]}}, ã {{IPA|[Ã¸]}}, ã {{IPA|[y]}} from ã {{IPA|[a]}}, ã {{IPA|[Ê]}}, ã {{IPA|[o]}}, ã {{IPA|[u]}}.

Till today they are used in smaller towns and are referred as &quot;Tanga&quot; and buggies (Victorias of Bombay) are still used for toursit purposes  ===Cycle Rickshaw=== From the early part of the century the bicycle rikshaws also became popular and are still used in rural India. Its more a bigger tri-cycle wherein two people can sit on a elavated seat at the back and a person will paddle (driver) from the front. In urban areas they have been mostly superceded by auto rickshaws.  ===[[Bicycles]]=== [[Image:Indian Couple on Bicycle.jpg|thumb|left|Bicycles are still an important mode of travelling for the lower middle class]]  ===Manually Pulled Rickshaw=== [[Image:Calcutta rickshaw.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Manually pulled rickshaw in [[Kolkata]]]] This type of transport was prevalent until 2005 in [[Kolkata]] wherein a person pulls the rickshaw. The Government of West Bengal banned these rickshaw in 2005 describing them &quot;inhuman&quot;. While this was lauded in general but questions about alternative means of livelihood of those who directly or indirectly depend on hand pulled rickshaws were not immediately addressed.  ===Trams=== {{main|Trams in India}}  The advent of the British saw trams being introduced in many cities including Mumbai and Calcutta. They are still in use in Calcutta and provide a pollution-free means of transportation.  The nationalised Calcutta Tram Company has introduced buses on certain routes in order to generate more revenue and reduce losses.  ==Local transport== Local transportation is predominantly by road, with a small fraction (depending on the city) by trains. Most Indian cities are connected to surrounding towns by buses or trains. The vast national rail network also enables farmers to transport their farm and agriculture produce to larger towns, where they get better prices.  The roads in most cities are poorly maintained and full of potholes, while in villages they are frequently non-existent. Traffic generally moves slowly and erratically, and traffic jams and accidents are very common. A [[Reader's Digest]] study of traffic congestion in Asian cities ranked several Indian cities within the Top Ten for worst traffic.  ===Buses=== [[Image:India.Mumbai.02.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A double-decker bus in [[Mumbai]]]] Buses are very cheap in most cities but also very crowded and have unpredictable timings, frequently necessitating long waits. In the big cities and towns of India, buses are the major mode of transport. Luxury and air-conditioned buses also service some cities. Most means of transportation within cities is run by the government. Buses are categorised, based upon the number of seats, the time it takes to travel from A to B, and general comfort. Express and limited buses are usually more expensive options compared to the normal ones, the latter being increasingly modern whilst cheap and easily accessible. {{seealso|Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport|Delhi Transport Corpp csos thc  g ]ice ngcme  p er

Generated seq by model:- on the New Testament as evidence of no painted icons amounts to an argument from silence.  Though the word ''eikon'' is found in the New Testament (see below), it is never in the context of painted icons. There were, of course, Christian paintings and art in the early [[Catacombs of Rome|catacomb churches]]. Many can still be viewed today, such as those in the catacomb churchs of Domitilla and San Callisto in Rome.  The earliest written records available of Christian images treated like icons are in a [[Paganism|pagan]] or [[Gnostic]] context. Alexander Severus (A.D. 222â235) kept a domestic chapel for the veneration of  images of deified emperors, of portraits of his ancestors, and of Christ, Apollonius, Orpheus and Abraham  (Lampridius, ''Life of Alexander Severus'' xxix.).  [[Irenaeus of Lyons|Irenaeus]], in his ''Against Heresies'' 1:25;6, says of the Gnostic Carpocratians, â''They also possess images, some of them painted, and others formed from different kinds of material; while they maintain that a likeness of Christ was made by Pilate at that time when Jesus lived among them. They crown these images, and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say, with the images of Pythagoras, and Plato, and Aristotle, and the rest. They have also other modes of honouring these images, after the same manner of the Gentiles'' [pagans].â   A criticism of image veneration is found in the apocryphal ''[[Acts of John]]'' (generally considered a [[gnostic]] work), in which the Apostle John discovers that one of his followers has had a portrait made of him, and is venerating it:   (27)  ''â...he [John] went into the bedchamber, and saw the portrait of an old man crowned with garlands, and lamps and altars set before it. And he called him and said: Lycomedes, what do you mean by this matter of the portrait?  Can it be one of thy gods that is painted here?  For I see that you are still living in heathen fashion''.â Later in the passage John says, ''&quot;But this that you have now done is childish and imperfect: you have drawn a dead likeness of the dead.&quot;'' [[Image:Ushakov Nerukotvorniy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Image of the Saviour Not Made by Hand'': a traditional Orthodox iconography in the interpretation of [[Simon Ushakov]] (1658).]]  In addition to the legend that Pilate had made an image of Christ, the 4th Century bishop Eusebius, in his ''Church History'', provides another reference to a âfirstâ icon of Jesus.  He relates that King Abgar of Edessa sent a letter to Jesus at Jerusalem, asking Jesus to come and heal him of an illness.  In this version there is no image.   Then, in the later account found in the Syriac ''Doctrine of Addai'', a painted image of Jesus is mentioned in the story; and even later, in the account given by Evagrius, the painted image is transformed into an image that miraculously appeared on a towel  when Christ pressed the cloth to his wet face (''Veronica and her Cloth'', Kuryluk, Ewa, Basil Blackwell, Cambridge, 1991).

Standard Italian is based on [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[dialect|dialects]] and is somewhat intermediate between the languages of [[Mezzogiorno|Southern Italy]] and the Gallo-Romance languages of the North.  Like many languages written using the [[Latin alphabet]], Italian has double consonants. However, contrary to, for example, [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], double [[consonant]]s are pronounced as long ([[gemination|geminated]]) in Italian. As in most [[Romance languages]] (with the notable exception of French), [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] is distinctive. Out of the Romance languages, Italian is generally considered to be the one most closely resembling [[Latin]] in terms of [[vocabulary]], though [[Romanian language|Romanian]] most closely preserves the grammar of Classical [[Latin]] while [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]  is the most conservative in terms of phonology.  ==History==  The history of the Italian language is quite complex but the modern standard of the language was largely shaped by relatively recent events. The earliest surviving texts which can definitely be called Italian (as opposed to its predecessor [[Vulgar Latin]]) are legal formulae from the region of Benevento dating from A.D. 960-963.  Italian was first formalized in the first years of the [[14th century]] through the works of [[Dante Alighieri]], who mixed southern Italian dialects, especially [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], with his native Tuscan in his epic poems known collectively as the ''[[Divine Comedy|Commedia]],'' to which [[Boccaccio]] later affixed the title ''Divina''.

It is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[democracy]] and the world's only [[Jewish state]].    ==Name and flag== The name &quot;Israel&quot; is rooted in the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Tanakh]], where [[Jacob]] is renamed Israel after wrestling with a mysterious adversary (&quot;a man&quot;, and later &quot;God&quot; according to [[Genesis (Old Testament)|Genesis]] 32:24â30; or &quot;the angel&quot;, according to [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] 12:4). ''Israel'' means &quot;he who has wrestled with God&quot;. The nation fathered by Jacob, were then called &quot;the children of Israel&quot; or the &quot;Israelites&quot;. Nowdays, they are commonly called [[Jew]]s after Jacob's son [[Judah]], the ancient father of the tribe of King [[David]]'s dynasty.  The [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flag]] is rooted in Jewish tradition. The white background symbolizes purity. The symbols on the flag are two stripesâone on the top and one on the bottomâand the [[Star of David]] emblem adorning the center. The stripes and blue color are inspired by the [[tallit]] (a Jewish prayer shawl).  == History == {{main|History of Israel}}  === Historical roots === {{see also|Kingdom of Israel}}  The earliest known mention of the name 'Israel', probably refering to a group of people rather than to a place, is the Egyptian [[Merneptah Stele]] dated to about 1210 [[Common Era|BCE]].[http://www.ebonmusings.org/atheism/otarch2.html#merneptah] For over 3,000 years, [[Jew]]s have held the [[Land of Israel]] to be their homeland, both as a [[Holy Land]] and as a [[Promised Land]].  The Land of Israel holds a special place in Jewish religious obligations, encompassing Judaism's most important sites â including the remains of the [[Solomon's Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple]], as well as the rites concerning those temples.

Generated seq by model:- methods of testing the quality of hashish are through [[Chemistry|chemical]] testing or consumption.  Hashish use is experiencing a resurgence in parts of [[North America]] (especially the [[Pacific Northwest]]) with the rise in popularity of a particularly pure and potent variety of hashish known as [[bubble hash]].  ==Preparation &amp; Methods of Ingestion==  ==='Hard' Hash===  This hash is usually between dark and light brown in colour, often crumbled into tiny pieces to obtain maximum surface area when burning. Once crumbled, it is often mixed with tobacco (although a tobacco alternative such as certain types of herbs may also be used). This mix can be rolled up into a cigarette with rolling papers (what is known as a 'joint' or 'spliff') and smoked like a normal cigarette. In Europe and North Africa many users break off a 1-2 cm piece of cigarette and use this as a 'filter'. In France and the French-speaking parts of Switzerland, this is known as rolling 'Maroc' ('Maroc' meaning 'Morocco' in French). In [[Spain]] it is called a 'Mora.' In the United Kingdom, it is variously known as 'draw,' 'hash,' 'rezzin' and 'block.'  If the hash is not crumbled fine enough or is of a low quality, small still-burning chunks of hashish may fall out of the lit end of the cigarette as it is being smoked. These can suddenly fall onto clothing, carpets, etc., immediately burning a hole. These are known sometimes as 'hot rocks,' 'hash rocks' or 'meteorites.' This is especially true of the hard, low-quality hash known as 'soap bar' which does not burn as easily or consistently, and is often prone to fall out of the end of the cigarette while still burning rather than simply burning along with the tobacco.  ==='Soft' Hash===   This is usually very dark brown to black in colour and goes under the name ''black'' in France, ''squidey black'' (named due to the colour and properties of the hash) in the UK, or ''pakis'' in Spain (meaning it originates from Pakistan). As this hash is softer, it can be rolled out into a long, thin ''spaghetti'' less than 1mm thick in diameter, with the heat of the fingers sufficient to soften the hash up enough to make it more pliable. This long, especially thin column of hash can be rolled up in a joint placed on a bed of tobacco or cannabis, burning along with the tobacco as the user inhales. The hash must be very thin to expose a maximum surface area, if not the tobacco will burn faster and the column of hash will remain sticking out the end of your joint, as the centre is left unburnt.   Alternatively, a North African technique called ''darbouz'' in Arabic can be used to ingest the ''spaghetti'' without having to roll it in a joint. One places a drinking cup on the table, sticks the prepared ''spaghetti'' of hash perpendicular into the side of a cigarette (not-burning), and jams the cigarette horizontally into the cup so that the hash hangs down inside the cup without touching the bottom or sides. The hash is then lit up and allowed to slowly burn almost like an incense stick whilst the top of the cup is  hft gaeil real teio i aahdim

The regular inhabitants of the empire's trading towns were the Arab and Swahili merchants with whom trade was conducted.   The [[Gokomere]] people, a [[Bantu]]-speaking group of migrant farmers, inhabited the Great Zimbabwe site from about [[500]]&amp;nbsp;CE, displacing earlier [[Khoisa]]n people. From about [[1000]], the fortress took shape, reaching its peak by the fifteenth century. These were the ancestors of the [[Shona people|Shona]] (or Mashona) people, who make up about 80% of modern Zimbabwe's population. Later they formed the [[Rozwi Empire]], which continued until the nineteenth century.  == Arrival of the Portuguese ==  In the early 16th century A.D. the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] arrived and destroyed this trade and began a series of wars which left the empire so weakened that it was near collapse in the early 17th century. Several Shona states came together to form the Rozwi Empire which covered more than half of present day Zimbabwe. By 1690 the Portuguese had been forced off the plateau and the Rozwi controlled much of the land formerly under Mwene Mutapa. Peace and prosperity reigned over the next two centuries and the centres of Dhlo-Dhlo, Khami, and Great Zimbabwe reached their peaks. As a result of the mid-19th century turmoil in [[Transvaal]] and [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]], the Rozwi Empire came to an end.  == Ndebele invasion == The [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Matabele]] (Ndebele) people in the south arrived in 1834 A.D.-- [[Mzilikazi]] fleeing [[Shaka]].  == British Conquest ==  British occupation began in the 1890s, under the leadership of [[Cecil Rhodes]], after whom the area was renamed Rhodesia. A treaty was signed with the [[British South Africa Company]] in 1888 allowing them to mine gold in the kingdom and to use force to enforce the terms of the treaty, now under Matabele rule. The increasing influx of settlers as a result of this treaty led to war with [[Lobengula]], King of [[Matabeleland]] in 1896-97. Lobengula died while fleeing north, and the Ndebele were defeated and European immigration began in earnest.  == Self-government ==  Rhodesia became a [[self-governing colony]] with responsible Government in 1923. What this meant was that there was a local parliament although some powers (notably relating to African political advancement) were retained by [[London]]. Southern Rhodesia (as it was called then) was ruled via the [[Dominions Office]] (and ''not'' the [[Colonial Office]]) although strictly speaking the country was not a Dominion (like [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]] etc.). This however was a unique case.   From 1953 to 1963, Southern Rhodesia was part of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]]. The federation fell apart in 1963 when white minority rule collapsed in the other members of the federation who were granted independence as [[Zambia]] and [[Malawi]]. Southern Rhodesia reverted to its status as a [[crown colony]] in Britain but was now known as [[Rhodesia]].  From 1953 thpra e.bs[d g,  ae ][io eispw]

On [[13 January]], Mulcahy replied to the anti-Treaty IRA officers to state that he would not call a convention without the authority of DÃ¡il Eireann as the Government of the Republic. On same day, Rory OâConnor wrote to Eoin OâDuffy stating that a convention would be called regardless. O'Connor added that OâDuffyâs orders would only be obeyed by the anti-Treaty section provided they were countersigned by himself.  On [[16 January]], the first IRA division â the 2nd Southern Division â repudiated the authority of the GHQ.   On [[18 January]], Richard Mulcahy chaired a meeting of the GHQ Staff, divisional commandants and some brigade commandants. It agreed to hold an Army Convention within two months and that, in a meantime, a 'watchdog' committee would be set up with representatives from both sides.  This committee did not meet often, however.   A month later, on [[18 February]], [[Liam Forde]], O/C of the [[IRA Mid-Limerick Brigade]], issued a proclamation stating that: &quot;We no longer recognise the authority of the present head of the army, and renew our allegiance to the existing Irish Republic&quot;. This was the first unit of the IRA to break with the pro-Treaty government.   On [[24 February]], the 'watchdog' committee established a month earlier met.  Rory O'Connor requested Mulcahy to secure DÃ¡il approval to hold an army convention on [[26 March]]. Three days later on [[27 February]], the DÃ¡il Cabinet sanctioned the Minister of Defence's request to hold an Army Convention. This decision was duly announced by IRA chief of staff, Eoin OâDuffy, who requested brigade conventions to assemble to elect delegates.  On [[5 March]], a stand-off developed between pro- and anti-IRA forces in [[Limerick]] over who would take control of a military barracks vacated by the departing British troops. A compromise was reached around the 12/[[13 March]].  Clearly concerned at developments in Ireland, and in Limerick in particular, on [[14 March]] [[Winston Churchill]] wrote to [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], warning him that: &quot;An adverse decision by the convention of the Irish Republican Army (so called) would, however, be a very grave event at the present juncture. I presume you are quite sure there is no danger of this&quot;. The following day, [[15 March]], the DÃ¡il cabinet decided to prohibit the holding of the Army Convention scheduled to take place on [[26 March]]. Amateur historian [[Dorothy Macardle]] claims that the banning of the convention arose because &quot;Mulcahy realised that 70 to 80 per cent of the IRA was against the Treaty and he feared that the Convention could have been used to establish a military dictatorship&quot;. However, issuing a summons under the title [[Republican Military Council]], 50 IRA senior officers including 4 GHQ staff, 5 divisional commanders and a number of brigade commandants, decided to go ahead with Convention.

Along with 56% arable land, it has significant sources of [[Coal]] (fourth-largest reserves in the world), [[Iron]] ore, [[Manganese]], [[Mica]], [[Bauxite]], [[Titanium]] ore, [[Chromite]], [[Natural gas]], [[Diamond]]s, [[Petroleum]], [[Limestone]], [[Thorium]] (world's largest along [[Kerala]]'s shores).  Petroleum is found off the coast of Maharashtra, Gujarat and in Assam, but meets only 40% of India's demand. Increasing amounts of natural gas are being discovering regularly especially off the coast of Andhra Pradesh. [[Uranium]] is mined in Andhra Pradesh and [[gold]] in the [[Kolar Gold Fields]] in Karnataka.  == International agreements == India is a party to several International agreements related to environment and climate, the most prominent among them are:  {| width=&quot;100%&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#fff4f4&quot; !align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Treaties and Agreements |-align=&quot;center&quot; !align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;| Specific Regions and [[Sea]]s |align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;|&lt;small&gt;[[Government of Antarctica|The Antarctic Treaty]], [[Law of the Sea]], Ship Pollution ([[MARPOL 73/78]]), [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling|Whaling]]&lt;/small&gt; |-align=&quot;center&quot; !align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;| [[Earth's atmosphere|Atmosphere]] and [[Climate]] |align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;|&lt;small&gt;[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Kyoto Protocol]], [[Montreal Protocol|Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|Nuclear Test Ban]]&lt;/small&gt; |-align=&quot;center&quot; !align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;| [[Biodiversity]], [[Natural environment|Environment]] and [[Forest]]s |align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;|&lt;small&gt;[[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Desertification]], [[Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna|Endangered Species]], [[Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques|Environmental Modification]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983|Tropical Timber 83]] and [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994|Tropical Timber 94]], [[Ramsar Convention|Wetland]]s&lt;/small&gt; |-align=&quot;center&quot; !align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;| [[Wastes]] |align=&quot;left&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot;|&lt;small&gt;[[Basel Convention|Hazardous Wastes]]&lt;/small&gt; |-align=r w   ueetlaihaati'    lsnoaun

Generated seq by model:-  [[Scandinavia]] (north-south), and between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the [[North Sea]] (east-west). Between [[800]] and [[1000]] the growing economic power of the [[Vikings]] led to its dramatic expansion as a major trading centre.  The following indicate the importance achieved by the town: * The town was described by visitors from England ([[Wulfstan]] - 9th C.) and the Mediterranean ([[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] - 10th C.). * Hedeby became the seat of a bishop ([[948]]) and belonged to the Archbishopric of [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]]. * The town minted its own coins (from [[825]]?). * [[Adam of Bremen]] (11th C.) reports that ships were sent from this ''portus maritimus'' to Slavic lands, to [[Sweden]], [[Samland]] (''Semlant'') and even [[Greece]].   A Swedish dynasty founded by [[Olof the Brash]] is said to have ruled Hedeby during the last decades of the [[9th century]] and the first part of the [[10th century]]. This was told to [[Adam of Bremen]] by the Danish king [[Sweyn Estridsson]], and it is supported by three [[runestones]] found in Denmark. Two of them were raised by the mother of Olof's grand-son [[Sigtrygg Gnupasson]]. The third runestone is from Hedeby, the ''Stone of Eric'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: Erikstenen) and it was discovered in [[1796]], which shows [[Runic alphabet#Younger FuÃ¾ark|Norwegian-Swedish runes]]. It is, however, possible that Danes also occasionally wrote with this version of the [[Runic alphabet#Younger FuÃ¾ark|younger futhark]].  ===Lifestyle=== Life was short and crowded in Hedeby. The small houses were clustered tightly together in a grid, with the east-west streets leading down to jetties in the harbour. People rarely lived beyond 30 or 40, and archaeological research shows that their latter years were often painful due to crippling diseases such as tuberculosis. Yet make-up for men and rights for women provide surprises to the modern understanding.  The Arab traveller Ibrahim [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] (late 10th C.) provides one of the most colourful and often quoted descriptions of life in Hedeby. Al-Tartushi was from [[Cordova]] in [[Spain]], which had a significantly more wealthy and comfortable lifestyle than Hedeby. While Hedeby may have been significant by Scandinavian standards, Al-Tartushi is unimpressed: :''&quot;Slesvig (Hedeby) is a very large town at the extreme end of the world ocean.... The inhabitants worship Sirius, except for a minority of Christians who have a church of their own there.... He who slaughters a sacrificial animal puts up poles at the door to his courtyard and impales the animal on them, be it a piece of cattle, a ram, billygoat or a pig so that his neighbors will be aware that he is making a sacrifice in honor of his god. The town is poor in goods and riches. People eat mainly fish which exist in abundance. Babies are thrown into the sea for reasons of economy. The right to divorce belongs to the women.... Artificial eye make-up is another peculiarity; when they wear it their beauthacai lm ] tpe gi tconet  r ho

Generated seq by model:- active_fiction.htm Interactive Fiction: More Than Retro Fun] A beginners introduction and setup guide to Interactive Fiction games and interpreters *[http://caad.mine.nu Club de Aventuras AD] (CAAD), the portal of the Spanish interactive fiction community.  == Alternative definitions == The term &quot;interactive fiction&quot; is also occasionally used to refer to [[hypertext fiction]] or [[collaborative fiction]].   It is also used to refer to literary works that are not read in a linear fashion, but rather the reader is given choices at different points in the text; the reader's choice determines the flow and outcome of the story. The most famous example of this form of interactive fiction is the [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] book series. Examples of interactive fiction are most often found in the genres of fantasy and science fiction and aimed at young readers, but examples can also be found in more adult-oriented genres such as romantic fiction and erotica.

It is one of the world's fastest sports, with players on [[skates]] capable of going high speeds on natural or artificial ice surfaces. The most prominent ice hockey nations are [[Canada]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], [[Slovakia]], and the [[United States]].  While there are 64 total members of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]], those seven nations have traditionally dominated the field for decades.  Of the sixty medals awarded in men's competition at the Olympic level from 1920 on, only six did not go to one of those countries (or a former entity thereof, such as [[Czechoslovakia]] or the [[Soviet Union]]) and only one such medal was awarded above bronze.  {{ref|medals}}  Unsurprisingly, ice hockey's worldwide popularity is concentrated primarily in locales cold enough for natural, long-term seasonal ice cover.
